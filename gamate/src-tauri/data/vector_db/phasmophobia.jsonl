{"content":"The bone is a collectible item that can be found on all maps. ==Mechanics== Every contract, one bone will spawn in a random location within the investigation area. The bone will spawn in a location that is accessible by the ghost, to reduce the risk of players being unable to retrieve it. One bone type of the human body will be randomly chosen for each contract. The player can the bone, causing it to disappear. The bone cannot be made to reappear for the rest of the contract once it has been picked up. Picking up the bone does not count against how many items one can carry. Once a type of bone has been picked up for the first time, it will appear in the display case in the lobby. Certain bones (such as hands and feet) must be collected twice to complete the collection. ===Rewards=== Taking a picture of the bone will yield up to $7 and 7 XP depending on the tier of the Photo Camera and whether there is a Unique stamp. Separately, picking up the bone will also yield the following base rewards, which will vary based on map size: {| class=\"article-table\" !Map size !Money ($) !Experience (XP) |- !Small |25 |25 |- !Medium |35 |35 |- !Large |50 |50 |} ===Types of bones=== Top Shelf (Left to Right): *Spine *Skull *Jaw *Right Scapula *Left Scapula Middle Shelf (Left to Right): *Right Hand *Right Humerus *Right Ulna *Right Radius *Ribcage *Left Radius *Left Ulna *Left Humerus *Left Hand Bottom Shelf (Left to Right): *Right Foot *Right Fibula *Right Femur *Pelvis *Left Femur *Left Fibula *Left Foot ==Tips== *As the bone's spawn location is relatively random, the bone may be hard to find. As a general rule of thumb, if you cannot stand in a particular spot (on top of kitchen counters, cabinets etc.), the bone is unlikely to spawn there. Bones should not spawn in closets, lockers, and small tents, since the ghost technically cannot enter them. With that being said, it should be noted that these delimitations are not foolproof, certain factors such as physics glitches or areas erroneously marked as pathable by the ghost may cause the bone to spawn in unexpected locations such as on top of furniture or in bathtubs. *In some maps (most notably Sunny Meadows), there is an occasional issue where the bone is said to spawn in a specific room (using an Ouija Board) but they actually appear in a neighbouring room. *Having bones that are thin or camouflage into the background may increase the difficulty of finding them, though it is also possible to miss bones that are in plain sight. *If you have not found the bone a while after completing other objectives and identifying the ghost, it may be wise to move on to avoid wasting time (and potentially lives) looking for it. *Dead players are able to see the bone, so searching for the bone may give them something to do while waiting for the game to finish. They could potentially lead the remaining living players to the bone by throwing an object to guide the way. *To maximise rewards, take a picture of the bone before picking it up. ==Trivia== *Prior to 0.4.0, the model of the bone appeared to be the femur (thigh bone) of a chicken. *The skeleton that you collect is missing the Tibia; the main bone of the lower leg. The Fibula, which you can collect in game, is the smaller bone of the lower leg that does not carry any weight while walking. The equivalent two bones of the lower arm, the Radius and Ulna, can both be collected. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access Alpha |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |3 March 2020 |Added Bones to the game. |- |One bone will spawn in the building per contract. |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !29 October 2020 |Bones will now tend towards the middle of the room. |- !0.4.0 |Replaced the bone model with new random bone models. |- !0.7.2.0 |Bones will now only spawn in areas accessible by the ghost. |- !0.9.0 |Rewards for collecting the bone will no longer be affected by the reward multiplier. |} ==See also== *Photo Camera Category:Item fr:Os ru:Кость","title":"Bone Evidence","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Bone_Evidence"}

{"content":"Camp Woodwind is a small map in Phasmophobia. It very much resembles Maple Lodge Campsite, but is much more compact in size, bearing only a handful of tents, a couple of bathrooms, and the central campfire. This map unlocks at player level 13. ==Structure== Camp Woodwind is analogous with 6 Tanglewood Drive for number of accessible areas (rooms vs. tents), but only possesses one open area pathway that can be circumnavigated around the main tent. This causes the map to feel almost unnervingly small and the ghost to be roaming very close to the entrance either way. There are four tents, three clustered near the Picnic Area and one near the Bathroom, and a campfire. In addition, there is a shed-like area towards the back, referred to as \"Lovers Bench\". There is a game of backgammon near the farthest tent and an inaccessible lighted area which leads further into the forest. ===Layout tips=== *The campfire has only one entrance and exit facing the entrance gates; take care not to get stuck trying to quickly run through, or be cornered within it by the ghost during a hunt. *For faster ghosts, looping around the only pathway may not be a suitable option due to its small size. Always prioritize smudging and hiding. *When lit, the campfire does not affect sanity drain but affects temperatures by maintening the Campfire room at even if the ghost is in that room, provided the weather is not Snow. ===Key hiding spots and strategies=== There are 7 \"sanctioned\" hiding spots on Camp Woodwind: *Campfire, behind multiple barrels next to Games Tent *Campfire, behind multiple cooler boxes next to Blue Tent *Picnic Area, behind cooler boxes next to White Tent *Yellow Tent, behind several sleeping bags on the right section *Kids' Area, two small tents (orange and cyan) *Food Tent, behind a table with multiple cooler boxes on it Depending on difficulty and settings, a portion or all of the hiding spots mentioned may be unavailable, either blocked by props or not present: *Amateur: None *Intermediate: 2 *Professional: 4 *Nightmare/Insanity: 5 *3-player game: +1 available hiding spot *4-player game: +2 available hiding spots <small>Additional hiding spots on multiplayer is overridden when \"Number of hiding places\" is set to None</small> Camp Woodwind is known for having many unreliable hiding spots, as ghosts frequently roam into some hiding spots, potentially killing players hiding there. These hiding spots are: Cooler boxes next to White Tent, the hiding spot behind the boxes in the Food Tent, and barrels next to the Games Tent. It is advised to hide in the small tents or use the furniture-based hiding spots next to the Blue Tent and/or in the Yellow Tent (if available) as ghosts roam less frequently in there. The Games Tent barrels are especially unreliable as the ghost can see the player through the small gaps between the barrels; if you must hide there, move as far back as possible and press yourself between the Games Tent and the barrel closest to it. Looping is a strategy to consider for this map, as the entire map has one main circular path that will take you around the Blue Tent and across the Lovers Bench. One can also loop the ghost around the campfire but beware, ghosts can easily kill a player inside the campfire circle while they are outside of it. The log between the two doesn't affect the ghost's reach! The picnic tables near the entrance can also be used to loop the ghost. If you crouch at the short ends of them, it will also break line of sight. Another feasible strategy on Camp Woodwind consists of \"strafing\" the ghost. One such spot is the ring of log seating around the campfire; if the player is agile enough, it is possible to force the ghost to constantly reroute its shortest pathing towards the player by constantly moving back and forth at the opposite side of the ring. ==Bone locations== Bones spawn randomly, but will only spawn in areas that a ghost can also walk on. ;Examples <div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\"><gallery widths=\"185\"> Bone ribcage woodwind.png|A ribcage in the white tent. Bone pelvis woodwind.png|A pelvis in the red tent. </gallery></div> ==Cursed possession locations== <div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\"><gallery widths=\"185\"> Woodwind Mirror.png|The Haunted Mirror spawns leaning on the tree with string lights near the Campfire. Woodwind MusicBox.png|The Music Box spawns in the Yellow Tent. Woodwind Ouija.png|The Ouija Board spawns inside the Games Tent. Woodwind Circle.png|The Summoning Circle spawns inside the Food Tent. Woodwind Tarot.png|The Tarot Cards spawn atop a picnic table in the Picnic Area. Woodwind Voodoo.png|The Voodoo Doll spawns out front of the small cyan tent next to the Red Tent. Woodwind MonkeyPaw.png|The Monkey Paw spawns on the left side of the Lovers Bench, next to the two marshmallow sticks. </gallery></div> ==Easter eggs== *Slenderman - Like on Maple Lodge Campsite, Slenderman has a chance of spawning on the outskirts of Camp Woodwind. He can be seen in the rocky area with fireflies toward the back of the map, in the crack between the white food tent and the bathroom, or near the truck on its left side. *Toilet Heart - A white heart can be seen on the toilets in the restroom building, which is a reference to the movie 'Saw'. *Several engravings can be found on the wall of the bathroom. These refer to the beta team. ==Trivia== *Camp Woodwind is one of two maps to only have one floor and one fuse box spawn location, the other being Sunny Meadows (Restricted) when using its Male Wing and Female Wing variations. *The map's name possibly came from a world-renowned sleep away summer camp called Camp Woodward that is located in Woodward, Pennsylvania, United States. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !0.7.0 |Added Camp Woodwind. |}<br> Category:Maps fr:Camp Woodwind ru:Camp Woodwind Category:Small Map","title":"Camp Woodwind","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Camp_Woodwind"}

{"content":"The Challenge Mode is a feature introduced in 0.8.1.0. It allows players to take part in a curated custom difficulty, often based on Professional, with predetermined rules and set of starter items. As players cannot bring their own items, dying in a challenge does not carry any significant monetary risk, encouraging players to experiment with strategies. Regardless of how difficult the challenge is, it always has a base reward multiplier of 1x, equal to Amateur. The main benefit of Challenge Mode is tied to the \"Complete Challenge Mode in [map name]\" Weekly Task, which awards a substantial $5,000 and 5,000 XP upon successful completion. Challenge Mode can be played on any map, and as many times as desired, but will not award completion of the aforementioned weekly task unless done on the intended map for the given challenge. Note that identifying the ghost is enough to count towards challenge completion, and the player does not need to survive the contract. Challenges specific to Sunny Meadows cannot be completed by playing Sunny Meadows (Restricted), and vice versa. ==Standard Challenges== There are 26 different standard challenges, which rotate each Monday at Midnight UTC.

{"content":"Weather is a mechanic intended to enhance gameplay and affect temperatures within the map. ==Mechanics== There are currently eight types of weather. Seven among which one will be randomly chosen per game with equal chance, and an additional eighth type that has a 2% chance to replace the chosen weather. Depending on what weather type is present, players may experience auditory and visual obstructions. Weather is grouped into four groups of temperatures. From warmest to coldest: * Sunrise * Clear, Fog, Blood Moon * Light Rain, Heavy Rain, Windy * Snow This can affect how the player finds the ghost; warmer weather means that the average room temperature where the ghost is will be slightly higher than in colder weather. The effects of weather are suppressed while indoors: noise disruption (save for the occasional roar of thunder) is quieted, and the visual effects of fog and precipitation do not make their way inside. However, weather can play a major part in Camp Woodwind and Maple Lodge Campsite, precisely as these maps are mainly played outside. ==Sunrise== overlooking the lake on Sunrise Weather.]] The sun is rising on the horizon (it does not actually move), casting golden rays onto the map, which may improve illumination in certain areas. The deep blue sky is untainted by clouds. Illumination: High Vision: High Noise disruption: Low Temperature: ==Clear== with Clear Weather.]] The \"standard\" weather type, and adds no additional features to gameplay. Surroundings are quite dim, and the sky is almost pitch black. Illumination: Poor Vision: High Noise disruption: Low Temperature: ==Fog== with Fog Weather.]] The map is covered in a thick mist, obscuring visibility. The fog dissipates inside buildings, but outdoor fog can be a hindrance to seeing with night vision outdoors through a video feed. Illumination: Modest Vision: Poor Noise disruption: Low Temperature: ==Blood Moon== with Blood Moon Weather.]] This weather provides a red sky and a light rain. The ghost becomes 15% faster during hunts, the passive sanity drain rate is increased by 100%, and the contract payout is increased by 10%. Illumination: Modest Vision: High Noise disruption: Medium Temperature: ==Light Rain== with Light Rain Weather.]] This weather type adds a modest rainfall, which generates some extra noise. Flames are not affected by the rain. Illumination: Modest Vision: High Noise disruption: Medium Temperature: ==Heavy Rain== with Heavy Rain Weather.]] The rainfall and thunder causes loud noise, and the map is shrouded by darkness. Non-tier III Igniters and Firelights cannot be lit in the rain. When an igniter or firelight affected by the rain is lit inside and brought outside, it will be extinguished immediately.

{"content":"Brownstone High School is a map in Phasmophobia. It was the first medium-sized map added to the game, though it is now a large-sized map. Its square shape and general symmetry can make it difficult to navigate, and its long hallways may make perpetual running almost impossible. ==Structure== Brownstone High School has one front and one side yard (separated from each other), about three dozen classrooms, eight bathrooms, a lecture hall, a cafeteria, and a gymnasium complete with two locker rooms. The entire building is approximately 85 by 55 meters. Brownstone High School features five exit doors. Due to the large distance between the closest entrance and the truck, it may be desirable to stage gear close to the building before entering. The rear exit doors lead onto a outdoor yard featuring an exterior basketball court. It is considered a safe zone, therefore preventing passive sanity drain. ===Layout tips=== *All hallways on both floors cannot be chosen as a favourite room, meaning Ghost Orbs do not need to be checked for in these hallways. The Lobby can be chosen as a favourite room, however. *The four Science Classrooms at the back of the building (two downstairs and two upstairs) each consist of two smaller sub-rooms: the classroom with chairs and the science lab with large metal tables. *There are four pairs of bathrooms on the map, with one pair per side per floor: **All male bathrooms are on the left, and all female bathrooms are on the right. **Each pair consists of a student's bathroom (labelled boys/girls) and a teacher's bathroom (labelled male/female). The teacher's bathroom is behind the \"regular\" bathroom (when looking towards the back). **The bathrooms are additionally labelled \"upstairs\" or \"downstairs\" respectively. *Classrooms numbered 20 and above are all located on the 2nd floor. The rest, classrooms 1-19, are downstairs. *The upstairs hallway is divided into three separate rooms by the game. The game calls each of these 6 hallway rooms a \"Corridor\" (rather than a \"Hallway\"). *In addition to doors and windows, fingerprints can also appear on bathroom mirrors. *The following rooms count as dim rooms and hence will drain sanity with 80% of the rate, even with all room lights being on: **Lobby, First Floor Main Corridor, First Floor Right Corridor, First Floor Left Corridor, Basketball Court, Lecture Hall, Second Floor Main Corridor, Second Floor Right Corridor, Second Floor Left Corridor. *Classroom 10 has no main room lights and hence no means of sanity drain prevention (other than firelights). ==Tips for surviving hunts== *Because of its many vast, empty rooms, the player should plan an escape route and identify a hiding spot as soon as the ghost is located, and always remain on their toes when investigating, especially if the favourite room is particularly expansive such as the Basketball Court or the Cafeteria. Be ready to run at the first sign of a hunt; using the brief grace period and strategic sprinting can make the difference between life and death. *This map is the only map in the game that has no official hiding spots at all; this means that only unofficial ones are available, which may not be reliable, and breaking line-of-sight to evade a ghost can be quite difficult due to how open the map is. Making sure to have Incense within reach can be very useful when still trying to collect evidence while sanity is nearing or below the hunt threshold, both to escape the ghost if spotted, and to prevent certain death if the ghost wanders into hiding spots. *Due to the very large size of the map, it may not even be necessary to hide if the player is sufficiently far from the ghost. The player can simply sit in a room far away from the ghost, as it would be extremely unlikely for it to wander by chance to the player's location if it has not detected them. **On the other hand, the large size of the map may make noticing the start of a hunt much more difficult. This can be particularly dangerous in hallways, as the player may be taken by surprise by a ghost that started hunting from far away. Communication between players and vigilance is key to avoid bad surprises; keeping exit doors open to hear or see them close and periodically trying to toggle light switches can help players know if a hunt started elsewhere in the building. *While all the lockers found on the map are simply decorative and therefore useless, the bathroom stalls are fair hiding spots during hunts, especially if the ghost does not see you enter the bathroom. *The Library contains several line-of-sight blockers, which can be used for both hiding and cutting off a chasing ghost. *The locker rooms on the left side of the first floor make for good hiding spots, as the lockers segregate the space and allow one to break line-of-sight or move away easier. *Some classrooms have hiding spots, such as in a corner next to some file cabinets, which block line-of-sight with the door. Knowing which ones do and which ones don't can save a player during hunts. Consider keeping open doors to classrooms with hiding spots and keeping closed those without. *The ghost is able to walk through many of the teacher's desks found in the classrooms, rendering them not useful for trying to loop the ghost. ==Bone locations== Bones spawn randomly, but will only spawn in areas that a ghost can also walk on. As Brownstone High School has a very large searchable area, looking for the bone is usually not a worthwhile endeavor; it is best either found incidentally or through use of a Ouija Board. ;Examples <small>Please note that the white bone model is no longer used.</small> <div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\"><gallery widths=\"185\"> Bone in Brownstone High School, First Floor, Right Side, Library.

Both rooms individually are also among the largest rooms in the game. * The assets used for this map can be found here. * There is a phone in every classroom that the ghost can ring as an interaction. In earlier versions of the game, this ringing was very loud and could be heard from great distances. * Brownstone High School is the only map in the game that doesn't have any official hiding spots. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access Alpha? |- !

{"content":"13 Willow Street (or simply Willow) is a map in Phasmophobia. It is a small, single-story home with two bedrooms and one bathroom, as well as a small garage and a basement. It is one of the smallest maps in the game, being only slightly larger than 6 Tanglewood Drive, but feels almost tiny due to its spacious open rooms, a sharp contrast to the generally congested environments of the other suburban homes. Willow can often make for a swift investigation due to its small size, but the lack of lockers, closets, and easily-accessible side rooms to hide in makes it relatively dangerous during a hunt. As such, players will have to learn the ins and outs of hiding behind furniture in order to survive. ==Structure== Willow consists of two bedrooms, one bathroom, a garage, and a large basement, among other rooms. See Third-party tools for a list of detailed map viewers that players may use. ===Key hiding spots and strategies=== Willow does not contain any closets or lockers, but 8 organic hiding spots are available: *Living Room, behind stacked storage crates in corner next to fireplace *Garage, behind shelf in laundry area *Garage, behind stacked storage crates along far wall *Garage, behind upright plywood in corner (when covered from side and front) *Boys Bedroom, behind stacked storage crates in back corner next to white wardrobe *Master Bedroom, behind black wardrobe (only when chair is next to it and facing the opposite corner) *Basement Hallway, behind trash cans at far end *Right Storage Room, behind blue tool cart Depending on the difficulty, some of these hiding spots may be blocked by the presence of bulky items or have their concealing elements removed: *Amateur: None *Intermediate: 3 *Professional: 5 *Nightmare/Insanity: 7 *3-player game: +1 available hiding spot *4-player game: +2 available hiding spots <small>Additional hiding spots on multiplayer is overriden when \"Number of hiding places\" is set to None</small> Several more unofficial furniture-based hiding spots are available. While they are more risky, they will never be blocked unlike official hiding spots, and can still provide decent hiding in most cases. Examples include: *Master Bedroom, behind the desk *Living Room, right against the bookshelf. While a decent replacement for the official hiding spot by the fireplace, it remains a risky option if the ghost wanders into the living room. Looping the ghost may be performed around the pickup in the garage, the kitchen island or around the two shelves in the Right Storage Room. The living room couch can also be used loop partially to move towards the kitchen if needed. ==Bone locations== Bones spawn randomly, but will only spawn in areas that a ghost can also walk on. ;Examples <div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\"><gallery widths=\"185\"> Bone willow hallway.png|A long bone in the Hallway.

{"content":"Asylum was the first large map to be added in the game. Its labyrinthine architecture, paired with its endless hallways and corridors, made for an intimidating venture, and even the most experienced paranormal investigator may find themselves getting lost. This map was replaced with Sunny Meadows Mental Institution. == Structure == The Asylum had 119 labeled rooms, the most on any map, while subdividing these into smaller, individual rooms would result in over 200 rooms. A large proportion of these are bedrooms, with other rooms such as a dentist room, conference rooms, canteens, barbers, storages, and more. This map's weather was always set to Clear Skies. === Layout tips === *All bedrooms are labeled starting with \"Size Bedroom #\", where Size is \"Two\", \"Four\" or \"Six\" and represents the number of beds in that bedroom, while # identifies the specific bedroom (e.g., the second four-bed room would be called Four Bedroom 2). Only the left/right wings of the first floor have bedrooms. The bedrooms fully occupy both outer rows of each wing (one row on the same side as the truck and the other on the opposite side). **\"Two Bedroom #\" rooms are the smallest bedrooms nearest to the middle of the building. Each of the 4 rows of bedrooms has a room called \"Two Bedroom #\". **\"Four Bedroom ##\" rooms are all on the same side of the map as the truck (at the bottom of the wings in the site map diagram). **\"Six Bedroom ##\" rooms are all on the opposite side of the map as the truck (at the top of the wings in the site map diagram). **There are no rooms in the map whose names begin with \"One\", \"Three\", or \"Five\". *The 4 rooms named \"Day Room #\" are all found on the first floor. *Because the map used to be rotated 180 degrees, all rooms with \"Right\" and \"Left\" labels are currently oppositely labeled. * All hallways and stairways cannot be chosen as a ghost room, meaning that players do not have to check for Ghost Orbs in these rooms. The rooms named Telephones and Lobby can still be ghost rooms. See Third-party tools for a list of detailed map viewers that players may use. === Key hiding spots and strategies === There are 2 sets of lockers in Asylum. These are always free to hide in, even on Nightmare difficulty. Players usually hide behind furniture or in rooms due to the lack of lockers. Alternatively, you can also hide in the bathroom stalls or in storage as a last resort. Due to Asylum being a large map, it is likely for ghosts to hunt from relatively far away in regards to the player's location, so the two would rarely meet before the actual ghost room is found (during multiplayer, these odds are increased by the number of players). However, it also makes the hunt much more dangerous when you have a ghost on your tail: due to large straight hallways, most ghosts can eventually gain on players, so getting cornered by a ghost becomes more likely. Ghosts such as the Yokai therefore are both harder to find and easy to escape from, but are still very dangerous in the open. Be wary of the ghost's general location when scouting for other objectives (like the Bone Evidence) or even just traversing the map in general, as telling that a hunt has started is much harder while the map's layout requires a different hiding strategy. == Bone locations == <blockquote>Please note that the white bone model is no longer used.</blockquote> Bones generally spawn randomly, though there is a slight bias for them to spawn closer to the middle of a room. Due to the large size of the Asylum map, it is usually best left to chance for players to find a bone or to make use of the Ouija Board, instead of attempting to search every room for it. ;Examples <gallery> File:BoneAsylum1.jpg|Basement Floor, Lounge 2, Left side of left corridor, three rooms down.

{"content":"The Banshee is a type of ghost in Phasmophobia. Banshees are noted for their distinctive screeches that they produce on the Parabolic Microphone or the Sound Recorder, as well as their targeting of only one specific player during hunts. ==Behaviour== ===Activity=== The Banshee has a higher chance of performing singing ghost events over other types. If the hunt target is the target of a singing event and causes the Banshee to disappear prematurely (by going near it), then their sanity will decrease by 15%, instead of the usual 10%. *Like other ghosts, who the Banshee targets for a ghost event is random and based on distance; being the hunt target by itself does not increase their chance of being the ghost event target. When in a D.O.T.S. state, the Banshee will try to move towards its hunt target instead of the nearest player. Contrary to most other ghosts, the Banshee is able to perform long roams while its current room is not the favourite room. ===Abilities=== When the Banshee performs a roam outside of hunts, if the hunt target is inside the investigation area, it has a 2/3 (67%) chance of triggering its ability which makes it perform a long roam to the target. Unlike the Wraith's and the Phantom's abilities, this will not create any EMF reading. The ability fails if the ghost and the hunt target are on different floors except if: *The map is Point Hope, *The Banshee was in a single-room basement or a single-room attic for all other maps. When a Parabolic Microphone or a Sound Recorder is used, the Banshee has a 33% chance of making 1 of its 20 unique screams instead of a regular paranormal sound. {| class=\"fandom-table\" !Banshee screams |- | |} ===Hunt=== At the start of the game a player is randomly selected as the hunt target. If the hunt target leaves the game or dies, a new hunt target will be selected. The new target is not random: the Banshee will select the first alive player in the list (established by the order the players joined the lobby) that is not the previous target, unless there is only one player remaining. The Banshee's hunt threshold is 50%, but it only checks the target's sanity when trying to hunt, rather than the average sanity like other ghost types, meaning that only the target needs to be at or below 50% sanity for it to attempt to hunt. As a result, the Banshee can appear to start hunting from as high as 87% average sanity, or as low as 12% average sanity, on the Sanity Monitor, depending on the target's current sanity and number of other players. When a Banshee hunts, it will mostly follow standard hunt rules, but it is unable to detect, and will ignore all players other than its hunt target. It will not attempt to chase other players and is unable to kill them, even if it comes into direct contact with a non-target player, instead passing through them. The Banshee will react to Incense lit by other players within range, but this will not allow for completion of the \"Repel a ghost while it is chasing someone\" optional objective unless the Banshee is also chasing its target when this occurs. If the hunt target is outside the building, the Banshee will still use its target's sanity to decide whether to hunt. However, if it does hunt, it will hunt like any other ghost, chasing any opportune player. ===Miscellaneous=== The Banshee can only be a female ghost and will use a female ghost model. ==Evidence== ==Strengths and weaknesses== These are the strengths and weaknesses as listed in the journal: Strength: Banshees will weaken their target before striking. Weakness: Banshees can sometimes be heard screaming with a parabolic microphone. ==Strategies== At the beginning of a contract, the Banshee can already be excluded if the ghost presents a masculine name. Identifying the target player of a Banshee both conclusively identifies it and can provide players with a significant edge, such as making hunt-related objectives much easier, and enabling the other players to continue investigating during hunts with impunity, though it is important to note that the target player must be inside the investigation area for this to be applicable. Alternatively, the target player can altogether prevent hunts indefinitely by topping up their sanity with Sanity Medication and staying outside the investigation area to never drop below the hunt threshold, for a completely safe investigation. There are several methods players may use to identify a Banshee's target: *Banshees will only check for the individual sanity level of the target player when attempting to hunt. If the ghost hunts above the average sanity of 50%, and one or more players are below 50% sanity, then one of them is the target. Likewise, if the ghost refrains from hunting at below 50% average sanity, but one player has high sanity, they can be presumed to be the Banshee's target; be mindful of mistaking it with ghosts that have different hunt sanity thresholds such as Demons or Shades. *Having players act as \"bait\" with Incense and/or escape routes ready can definitively identify the target. Bait players should stand in plain sight and attempt to actively attract the ghost, such as talking into the microphone/holding active electronics or letting the ghost spot them; if the ghost ignores them, have another player repeat the process then proceed by elimination until the target is found. Alternatively, if the ghost is already confirmed to be a Banshee, multiple players can do this at the same time, standing separate from each-other and seeing which of them the Banshee rushes for. This method, though more risky, is useful either when the sanity-based method proves inconclusive, or when playing on Nightmare/Insanity difficulty where the Sanity Monitor is not available. Ensure that all players are inside the building when performing this test. **Be aware that the Banshee might coincidentally wander towards a player after it has lost sight of its target, especially in hallways or cluttered rooms, giving the impression that it is chasing that player. In that case, observe its line of sight acceleration or attempt to move out of its way to see if the ghost is actively following you. *Banshees tend to wander towards their target outside of hunts; a player reporting frequent activity or even hunts starting near them and far away from the ghost room is most likely the target. Using motion sensors and salt can help to track the ghost's location. Note that if the target player dies or disconnects, a new target will be selected. This also applies on Nightmare/Insanity difficulty or when the \"Kills extend hunts\" setting is turned on: if the Banshee manages to kill its target, it will immediately select another player and continue hunting. On singleplayer, determining the Banshee by its target ability is impossible, making it much more difficult to identify through behavior alone, so one must rely on other potential tells or pieces of evidence. Using a Parabolic Microphone or a Sound Recorder to pick up its unique sounds might come in handy, though note that the Banshee only has a chance of producing its screams instead of a regular paranormal sound, so it mustn't be ruled out if the ghost doesn't produce any screams. Other singleplayer tells include a lot of singing events, and wandering to the player frequently (note that Phantoms also have this ability; theirs will, however, leave an EMF reading while Banshees will not).

{"content":"The firelight is a piece of equipment in Phasmophobia. It is a deployable light source that can be lit using a source of fire such as an igniter or another firelight. It can be used to continuously light up a room with a warm, orange glow, and mitigate sanity drain from darkness, until it eventually burns out. Ghosts tend to blow out nearby firelights, making them effective at checking if a ghost is nearby. ==Usage== ===Lighting firelights=== Players can light a firelight held in their hand by pressing if they have an igniter in their inventory. A firelight placed down can be lit while holding an igniter and pressing . One can also hold a lit firelight, aim at an unlit firelight, and use the Secondary Use key. An unorthodox way is to have the wick of one lit and one unlit firelight to collide (this may need velocity). ===Placement=== Firelights can be down on surfaces. Holding the placement key will show a translucent highlight of the firelight. This will place the firelight upright relative to the surface. Firelights can topple/fall over when placed on a slope or vertically. ===Function=== When a player is within 2 metres of a lit firelight, it will slow passive sanity drain that results from being in the dark, at a rate depending on the firelight's tier level. Lit firelights do not affect sanity drain from other sources such as ghost events or other players dying. Ghosts can blow out firelights at any time, even during hunts, and this will create an EMF 2 reading (or EMF Level 5). When blown out, the firelight will be extinguished with a blowing \"sigh\" effect. A firelight will also extinguish by itself at the end of its duration which depends on its tier level. Tier I and Tier II firelights will produce smoke when blown out by the ghost or self-extinguishing. Contrary to fire sources, however, ghosts cannot light firelights up. Like with fire sources, when a firelight is lit up for the first time, there will be a 30-second cooldown before the ghost can attempt to blow it out. After the end of that cooldown or on subsequent lightings, a new cooldown is set with a random duration between 20 and 80 seconds. The Onryo can bypass these cooldowns due to its hunt prevention mechanics. *Note that Tier III firelights will pause the current cooldown if they are turned off by the player or an Onryo's hunt attempt. Ghosts have a 66.67% (2/3) chance to blow out a lit firelight provided they are within 5 meters and the cooldown is over. *Tier II firelights are more likely to be blown out due to them having three candles, each rolling the same 66.67% chance and if one of the three chances is successful, all three candles are blown out, roughly making it a 96.30% chance overall. Despite being multiple candles, the tier II firelight still counts as one flame for the Onryo. a lit firelight/one falling with sufficient velocity (Tiers I and II only), placing it in the inventory, leaving it out in heavy rain (Tiers I and II only), or pressing while held in hand will cause it to extinguish. ==Tips== *Placing firelights on the sides of tables, shelves, or other elevated objects may improve their lighting by covering a wider area. *In larger maps like Brownstone High School or Sunny Meadows Mental Institution, firelights may be helpful as navigation markers for important areas such as the fuse box, ghost room, or exit door(s), also providing some helpful sanity drain reduction as a bonus, though they are not as reliable as spare UV lights or flashlights, as firelights both burn out after a time (except for tier III) and can be blown out by the ghost. *As non-electronics, firelights are less affected by hunts (other than potentially being blown out), neither do they attract the ghost. Players may use firelights as constant light sources to navigate during hunts. A potential but generally trivial downside is that it removes a source of alert as to whether the ghost is hunting (or performing ghost events). ==Objectives== {| class=\"article-table\" !

{"content":"|265x265px]] Hiding Spots are features within a Map that allow players to survive hunts. ==Mechanics== ===Availability=== The number of available hiding spots depends on the difficulty as well as the number of players: *Amateur: All spots available *Intermediate: At least 3 spots available *Professional: At least 2 spots available *Nightmare/Insanity: At least 1 spot available *3 players: +1 spot available *4 players: +2 spots available For example, a Professional game with 3 players will have at least 3 hiding spots available throughout the entire map. By using a custom difficulty, hiding spots can also be turned off entirely, overriding all other rules. When a spot is unavailable, it can be blocked off with \"junk\"/storage equipment, be sealed behind a locked door, or have its concealing elements removed. The unavailable spots are randomly chosen at the beginning of each investigation. ===List of hiding spots=== A full list of hiding spots is available on each map's own page. See Map § List of maps. ==Tips== ]] * The ghost cannot open a closet/locker door that is currently being held by a player; Ideally, using this method, the ghost can only open one of the closet doors. Both doors can be held, in multiplayer. ** When hiding in a closet with one door fully open, you must hug the door you are holding to have better chances at survival. ** However, if the ghost detected the player inside or near a closet/locker, the ghost will forcibly open the doors, overriding the player holding the door shut. * Players are not forced to use \"official\" hiding spots. Some players may improvise and use furniture such as kitchen tables/islands to hide. As a general rule of thumb, if an object covers the player to at least their eye level, it can (but may not) work as a viable hiding spot.

{"content":"The ID Card is a cosmetic that shows the player's in-game progress. ==Features== The ID card shows the name of the player, the platform they're playing on (Steam, PlayStation, or Xbox), their level, the player's badge, and their selected character model. For the player's own ID card, the bar shows the amount of experience needed to level up. When looking at other players' ID cards, the bar is used to adjust their voice chat volume. By default, the volume is set to 50%. The character model can be changed by clicking on the model portrait, and a player's badge can be changed by clicking the customize button in the top right corner. ===Roles=== By default, players are assigned the Ghost Huntin' Intern role. Different roles can be obtained through the prestige system, holiday events, contributing to the development of the game, being a Kinetic Games Partner, or through community-related events. Players that obtain a new role will also obtain a new badge that the role is linked to. The badge must be displayed on a player's profile to display the role. ===Prestige Badges=== Upon reaching Level 100 the player has the option to Prestige. Players will receive a new badge every Prestige that affects the role and color of the ID Card. Prestige Badges will also be displayed on the left shoulder of the player's character model, below the Legacy Badge. A player's prestige level will appear as Roman numerals prefixing their level (i.e. VI-002). Prestiges 1-10 display an ID Card with a static background and badge, while prestiges 11-20 display an ID Card with an animated background and badge. <table-progress-tracking table-id=\"1\" unique-column-index=\"3\"> {| class=\"fandom-table\" !Role !ID Card design !Prestige |- |Intern | |Prestige 0 (Default) |- |<span style=\"color: #E7A638;\">Recruit</span> | |Prestige 1 (I) |- |<span style=\"color: #DA3382;\">Investigator</span> | |Prestige 2 (II) |- |<span style=\"color: #ECBF5D;\">Pvt.

{"content":"0.9.0, also known as the Ascension update, is a major update that released on 17 August 2023. The update centers around an overhaul of the progression system, including a reset of existing player levels, money, and equipment, a new tiered system of equipment and evidences, leveling prestiges, and an overhaul of rewards, among other changes. ==Additions and Changes == ===Progression=== *A new leveling system has been added, with new rates of progression, new unlocks, and a prestige system. **For this system to function, all current players have been reset to Prestige 1, level 1, this way you can continue to play with your unlocked difficulties and locations. New players will start at Prestige 0, level 1. *Upon launching the game for the first time after updating, you will be presented with a new screen to choose a unique badge with options based on your pre-update level. Once saved, this is un-editable so choose carefully! ===Equipment=== *Each equipment item now has 3 tiers, increasing our Equipment count from 22 to 60! Tiers cost a large sum of money to unlock, but each tier will cost the same to bring into a contract. **To upgrade a piece of equipment, reach the required level, go to the shop and press on any item’s UI tile on the screen, then hit upgrade! *Several names have been replaced to accommodate changes or for the new upgrade tiers, so that the word covers a broader spectrum: **Fingerprints (evidence) -> Ultraviolet **Footsteps (photos and descriptions) -> Footprints **Candles and Lantern -> Firelight **Matchbox and Lighters -> Igniter **Smudge Sticks and Censer -> Incense **Camcorders and Movie Camera -> Video Camera **Glow sticks and UV torches -> UV Light **Sanity Drink, Pills and Shot -> Sanity Medication **Head Mounted Camera, Flashlight and Goggles -> Head Gear **Weak or Strong flashlights -> Flashlight ====D.O.T.S Projector (Evidence)==== *You will no longer get duplicate DOTS ghosts, or DOTS triggering during events, hunts or other interactions *Ghosts with DOTS evidence can now enter a short “DOTS state”; where they are temporarily visible with infrared light, during this time they will wander towards the nearest player before disappearing (if the player is in the same room) *DOTS Ghost photos now count as normal ghost photos ====Firelights and Igniters==== *You can now turn off Firelights by pressing the Use button again while holding it *Firelights now have a duration for their effects, and no longer stop the sanity drain completely, with different amounts of sanity benefits per tier ====Parabolic Microphone==== *When using a Parabolic microphone, you will now clearly hear all sounds you are aiming towards, within range, while all other sounds will be muffled ====Incense==== *The interval in which the ghost checks if an Incense is active, is now much smaller, making repelling the ghost much more consistent *Using Incense during another Incense's effect will now reset the timer instead of doing nothing ====Salt and Ultraviolet==== *Salt will now only reveal footprints if the ghost has Ultraviolet evidence *UV prints must now be charged by being shined on with a UV light to take a successful photo *Footprints will be affected by ghost traits similar to Fingerprints *Glowsticks can now be used again after they dim to shake and revitalize the light they produce ====Thermometers and Temperatures==== *Thermometers are now counted as a starter item alongside the other evidence items *The cold breath effect will now show at 5 degrees Celsius and below. * You must now use a Thermometer to find freezing temperatures at 0 Celsius (32 Fahrenheit) or below *To receive a room temperature reading you must now hold the “Use” button for a short period (Tiers II and III only) *Room temperatures will now be much more consistent between players **Freezing ghosts can lower the temperature to -10C, non-freezing ghosts can lower to 1C **Temperatures will now drop at 1/3 the current speed, if the temperature is below the minimum weather temperature ====Tripods and Video Cameras==== *Max amount reduced to 4 *Ghosts can now throw video cameras like other items *Ghosts can now rarely knock over tripods ====Consumables==== Some items are now consumable! This means that if you use an item during a contract, marked as “consumable” in the shop, you will have to purchase it again when you leave. Disabling \"lose items\" in Custom Difficulty will not consume items (rewards are still set to 0x) *Crucifix: All tiers * Firelight: I and II *Igniter: All tiers *Incense: I and II *Salt: All tiers *Sanity Medication: All tiers ==== Photo System==== *Added a new photo camera system which takes into consideration the distance and view angle of the evidence. This will significantly change the quality of photos. * Evidence in photos will now need to be closer and centralized to get a higher quality reward. === Rewards=== Several rewards have had their values adjusted to feel more rewarding and encourage the completion of objectives *Rewards for all objectives, tasks and the weekly challenge have been increased drastically *Any experience earned will now give you the same amount in dollars *Rewards for collecting the bone will no longer be affected by the reward multiplier ===Training === The Training mission has been replaced with a brand-new experience, to access it press the training button on the main menu. This version of Training is set in a custom-built warehouse, with different rooms to show the player how to use each item of Evidence equipment, as well as give tips and tricks on how to play the game in a controlled environment. ===Gamepad 2.0=== *Added gamepad UI button controls for the Journal, voice recognition text and the main menu screen * Replaced gamepad UI navigation with a virtual on-screen cursor ===Blocking Players=== You can now block other players.

{"content":"10 Ridgeview Court (or simply Ridgeview) is a small map in Phasmophobia. A two-story, four-bedroom house with a garage and basement, Ridgeview presents a spacious living area, giving way to more congested linear hallways. However, the presence of closets and multiple sub-rooms to dive into provides plenty of safety during a hunt. ==Structure== Ridgeview has four bedrooms, four toilets, a garage and a basement, among other rooms. ===Layout tips=== *The \"Master Bedroom\" consists of the bedroom itself, the attached bathroom, and the closet that can be accessed through said bathroom. *The small hallway leading to \"Master Bedroom\" is considered part of \"Kitchen\". *The Upstairs Hallway includes both the main hallway that turns a corner and leads to \"Boys Bedroom\" and \"Bathroom\" and the straight hallway partially separated by a wall that leads to \"Teen Boys Bedroom\", \"Girls Bedroom\", and \"Upstairs Toilet\". *In order to fully prevent passive sanity drain in the Foyer, the light switch that turns on the lamp outside at the entrance door has to be turned on as well. *There is a bug where the computer in Hallway needs to be turned on to prevent passive sanity drain in that room. See Third-party tools for a list of detailed map viewers that players may use. ===Key hiding spots and strategies=== There are 10 \"sanctioned\" hiding spots in Ridgeview: *Living Room, behind stacked storage crates in corner by fireplace *Garage, lockers near entrance door *Garage, lockers along far wall *Basement, lockers directly across from door *Basement, behind stacked storage crates in corner (after entering and turning left twice) *Master Bedroom, behind storage crates in walk-in closet *Upstairs Hallway, closet at top of stairs *Upstairs Hallway, closet between boy's bedroom and bathroom *Upstairs Hallway, closet between girl's bedroom and teen boy's bedroom *Boy's Bedroom, closet across from bed Depending on the difficulty, a number of these hiding spots will be randomly blocked by bulky items or have the concealing elements removed, preventing players from hiding in them: *Amateur: None *Intermediate: 5 *Professional: 7 *Nightmare/Insanity: 8 *3-player game: +1 available hiding spot *4-player game: +2 available hiding spots <small>Additional hiding spots on multiplayer is overridden when \"Number of hiding places\" is set to None</small> Several more unofficial furniture-based hiding spots are available such as: *Kitchen, behind the fridge *Hallway, behind the piano or the computer Looping the ghost may be performed around the dining table. The ghost can also be looped around multiple shelves in the Basement (the collection of shelves on the right side opposite one of the Fuse Box locations is the easiest spot). ==Bone locations== Bones spawn randomly, but will only spawn in areas that a ghost can also walk on. ;Examples <div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\"><gallery widths=\"185\"> Bone Ridgeview diningroom.png|A bone under a chair in the dining room that may be easily missed.

{"content":"42 Edgefield Road (or simply Edgefield) is a small map in Phasmophobia. It is a two story, six-bedroom house with a basement, with a congested, claustrophobic environment. Despite the thin hallways, there are plenty of hiding spaces during a hunt, as a room to hide in is always a few paces away. Its tight hallways can often make it difficult to see past fellow investigators, and a team member may be encouraged to set up Video Cameras and observe key investigative details from the truck. ==Structure== Edgefield contains six bedrooms (including a nursery), six toilets, a dining room, a garage, and a basement, among other rooms. ===Layout tips=== *Both the basement hallway and the storage room separated by a door is considered a single \"Basement\" room. *For every bedroom on the second floor, the game considers both the room with the bed and the attached bathroom, if any, to be a single room. *In order to fully prevent passive sanity drain in the Hallway, the light switch controlling the outside lamp above the entrance door has to be switched on as well. *There is a bug where the computer in Small Blue Bedroom needs to be turned on to prevent passive sanity drain in that room. See Third-party tools for a list of detailed map viewers that players may use. ===Key hiding spots and strategies=== There are 9 \"sanctioned\" hiding spots in Edgefield: *Utility, back corner between shelves and washer (crouch against the washer) *Garage, lockers against far wall *Basement, lockers next to refrigerator *Small Blue Bedroom, closet at back *Upstairs Hallway, 2 closets across from green bedroom *Large Blue Bedroom, closet at back corner *Master Bedroom, 2 closets across from bed Depending on the difficulty, some of these hiding spots will be filled with bulky items, preventing players from hiding in them: *Amateur: None *Intermediate: 3 *Professional: 5 *Nightmare/Insanity: 7 *3-player game: +1 available hiding spot *4-player game: +2 available hiding spots <small>Additional hiding spots on multiplayer is overridden when \"Number of hiding places\" is set to None</small> Several more unofficial furniture-based hiding spots are available. While they are more risky, they will never be blocked unlike official hiding spots, and can still provide decent hiding in most cases. Examples include: *Hallway, behind a cupboard at the rear end of the hallway *Living Room, behind the bookshelf. It will block line-of-sight from the doorway, but it can be very risky if the ghost enters the living room. *Basement, behind the shelves in the storage room Looping the ghost is only possible around the living room couch, but the latter doesn't block line of sight. Using tier III Salt can be useful to slow down the ghost if one wants to test for certain ghosts (especially Poltergeist and Obake). ==Bone locations== Bones spawn randomly, but will only spawn in areas that a ghost can also walk on. ;Examples <div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\"><gallery widths=\"185\"> Bone edgefield utility.png|A large bone in a rug in Utility.

If the ghost is a Demon, this might even happen with a tier I Crucifix. *The assets used for this map can be found here. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access Alpha |- !19 March 2020 |Split the basement into two rooms mechanic-wise. |- !? |Converted the basement back into a single room. |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !0.7.0 |Renamed Edgefield Street House to 42 Edgefield Road. |}<br> Category:Maps Category:Small Map fr:42 Edgefield Road ru:42 Edgefield Road","title":"42 Edgefield Road","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/42_Edgefield_Road"}
{"content":"Bleasdale Farmhouse is a medium map in Phasmophobia, and one of the two Farmhouse variants, alongside Grafton Farmhouse. With two well-defined main floors, and a spacious attic, Bleasdale can feel quite big, but still plenty manageable for a small team. ==Structure== Bleasdale Farmhouse has three floors, including an attic. Rooms consist of two bedrooms, three bathrooms, an office, two hallways, and outdoors areas, among others. ===Layout tips=== *The investigation area includes both the house itself, as well as its backyard and the garden. *There are motion-triggered lights around the outside of the house, which can be triggered not only by players, but also the ghost.

{"content":"6 Tanglewood Drive (or simply Tanglewood) is a small map in Phasmophobia. It is a small single-story home. Tanglewood can often make for a swift investigation due to its small size, but the open floor plan and only three accessible coat-closets can cause it to be very dangerous during a hunt. ==Structure== Tanglewood has three bedrooms (including a nursery), two toilets, a garage, and a basement, among other rooms. ===Layout tips=== *The \"Master Bedroom\" consists of the room of the bedroom itself, the attached bathroom, and the attached closet. *The \"Foyer\" consists of both the hallway starting from the front door until the closet at the end of the hall leading into the living room, and the hallway parallel to it connecting \"Boy Bedroom\", \"Nursery\", and \"Main Bathroom\". *A maximum of 9 light switches can be turned on at once before tripping the breaker. ===Key hiding spots and strategies=== There are 6 \"sanctioned\" hiding spots in Tanglewood: *Foyer, closet between nursery and bathroom *Foyer, closet next to living room *Boy Bedroom, closet across from bed *Nursery, behind the crib *Garage, lockers along far wall *Basement, behind upright plywood Depending on the difficulty, some of these hiding spots will be filled with bulky items or missing their concealing elements, preventing players from hiding in them: *Amateur: None *Intermediate: 2 *Professional: 3 *Nightmare/Insanity: 4 *3-player game: +1 available hiding spot *4-player game: +2 available hiding spots <small>Additional hiding spots on multiplayer is overriden when \"Number of hiding places\" is set to None</small> Another decent, but unofficial hiding spot is in the nursery.

This will create an EMF Level 2 reading, with a 33% chance of it being EMF Level 5 instead if the ghost has this evidence. The alarm cannot be activated during hunts. The alarm persists until the players deactivate it by with the vehicle while having the car key, which is always located in the first room when entering the house.

{"content":"The EMF reader is a buyable piece of equipment used to read the strength of electromagnetic fields in the nearby environment. The EMF reader is used to detect evidence of EMF Level 5. ==Mechanics== The reader can be on to begin reading any emissions. The device's effective range, as well as how the reading is displayed, is dependent on the tier of the EMF Reader. Holding an active EMF reader within 7.5 metres of a ghost (or 2.5 metres for a Yokai) during a hunt on the same floor will attract the ghost. During hunts or when the ghost manifests, EMF readers within 10 metres of the ghost (or higher for a Raiju) will malfunction and display random values between level 1 and 4. === Tier I === The Tier I EMF Reader is an old GheistField Meter. It is reminiscent of an old Geiger counter, and has a 1.7 metre range at which it can pick up readings. When in range of an EMF reading, it will begin clicking and the dial will move to the rough area corresponding to the value of the EMF source, though the dial will sway up or down a bit due to its age. When EMF Level 5 is detected, the dial will quickly shoot all the way to the right, and sway a lot less down, staying at and far past the level 5 mark (staying at and below does not count). === Tier II === The Tier II EMF Reader is the K2 Meter. The K2 is a small black box adorned with five colored LED lights, each one indicating a different EMF reading. The K2 has an effective range of 2 metres. When detecting an EMF emission, the reader will light up various numbers of its LEDs, accompanied with a pitch associated with the measured reading's level. If multiple EMF emissions are in range, the one with the highest EMF level will be indicated by the reader, though some fine positioning may be able to change which reading its being given out. When EMF Level 5 is detected, all five lights will be illuminated, and it will make a very high pitch tone. === Tier III === The Tier III EMF Reader is the EMF ParaMeter. It is similar in design to a PDA, with a blocky black plastic shell and a large center screen. It has a 3.5 meter range. It is able to read and track up to three interactions at once, giving the reading's EMF level by filling in dashes, and additionally reads out how far away that the reading occurred from the device (in meters) as well as the direction at which the interaction happened, allowing for the holder to quickly track down where the EMF emission is sourced from. When detecting something that is not EMF Level 5, it will create a beeping sound. When detecting EMF Level 5, all dashes will fill and a unique beeping noise that is higher pitched will play. === EMF levels=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !EMF Level !!LED Colour (Tier II Reader) !!Ghost Activity |- !1 | <center><span class=\"clr\" style=\"color: #0080ff\">Blue</span></center> |None, default state |- !2 | <center><span class=\"clr\" style=\"color: #199b1e\">Green</span></center> |Interacting with an object<br>Using an ability |- !3 | <center><span class=\"clr\" style=\"color: #e8c252\">Yellow</span></center> |Throwing an object |- !4 | <center><span class=\"clr\" style=\"color: #ff8800\">Orange</span></center> |Manifestation |- !5 | <center><span class=\"clr\" style=\"color: #ff0000\">Red</span></center> |Evidence (33% chance) |} == EMF Level 5 == If the ghost has EMF Level 5 as a possible piece of evidence, each EMF occurrence of Levels 2 or 3 has a 33% chance to be a Level 5 emission instead. EMF Level 5 does not necessarily indicate strong activity or immediate danger to the player. ==Tips== * If players are looking for evidence of EMF Level 5, players should use the reader every time the ghost touches an object or surface, and within the 20 second period that the EMF will be active for. * It may be possible to mishear a pitch for EMF 5, especially with certain speakers. Visually read off the EMF level to be certain. * EMF Readers, especially Tier II readers, create a substantial amount of noise when malfunctioning, making discarded ones good beacons of the ghost's general location during a hunt. ==Gallery== <gallery> File:Emf reader.jpg|thumb|Old EMF reader model File:Analog EMF attached to the wall.png|Tier I EMF reader on the wall in the main hall.

{"content":".]] .]] .]] Fire sources are a map feature which the ghost can interact with. ==Mechanics== Fire sources can be found at specific spots on several maps. Players can light these fire sources by using the button while having a lit igniter or firelight in hand. When a ghost interacts with a fire source, it can either light it up or blow it out. In both cases, an EMF 2 reading (or EMF Level 5) will be created at the fire source. The Onryo cannot light fire sources, and no ghost can light the Summoning Circle's candles. When a fire source is lit up for the first time, there will be a 30-second cooldown before the ghost can attempt to blow it out. After the end of that cooldown or on subsequent lightings, a new cooldown is set with a random duration between 20 and 80 seconds. The Onryo is the only ghost that can bypass these cooldowns due to its hunt prevention mechanics. Ghosts have a 66.67% (2/3) chance to blow out a lit fire source provided they are within 5 meters and the cooldown is over. Lit fire sources cannot be turned off by players, and will never self-extinguish (except for the Summoning Circle's candles, which instantly self-extinguish if the player lights them up while having less than 16% sanity). ===Rewards=== Three pieces of media can be recorded with fire sources: a Fire Interaction video when a fire source is lit by the ghost, and a Fire Extinguish video and a Fire Extinguish sound when a fire source is blown out by the ghost. All of these can reward up to $7 and 7 XP, depending on the equipment tier and whether there is a Unique stamp.

{"content":"The Deogen is a type of ghost in Phasmophobia. It has a talent for quickly rushing down players during a hunt no matter where they are, but is slow to approach when closing in for the kill. ==Behaviour== ===Activity=== If the player asks any question through the Spirit Box while standing within 1 metre of the Deogen, it has a 33% chance with each question to produce a unique response of constant heavy bull-like breathing, instead of a regular response. ===Hunt=== The Deogen's hunt sanity threshold is 40%, instead of the usual 50%. During a hunt, the Deogen always has line-of-sight with all players on the map; in other words, it does not use the \"roaming\" mechanic. When the hunt begins, the Deogen will pick the nearest player (by straight-line distance) to move towards. It will focus that player for 10 seconds before being able to check and repick the nearest target every 5-10 seconds throughout the hunt. One can also use Incense to stun the Deogen temporarily and force it to change its target when the smudge effect runs out. When the Deogen is chasing a player, its speed is based on its pathfinding distance to the target player and has three thresholds: above 6 meters, between 6 and 2.5 meters and below 2.5 meters. *> 6m: 3 m/s *Between 2.5 - 6m: Assumed speed gradient between 0.4 - 3 m/s *< 2.5m: 0.4 m/s If the Deogen is smudged or is otherwise not chasing any player, its speed will remain at its current speed, or 1.6 m/s if its current speed is greater than 3 m/s. Otherwise, the Deogen does not alter its speed based on line-of-sight while chasing a player. During a hunt, the Deogen flickers and is on average invisible for shorter and visible for longer compared to most other ghosts: {| class=\"fandom-table\" !Ghost !Visibility length (s) !Invisibility length (s) !Total per-flicker length (s) |- |Deogen* |0.20 - 0.30 |0.01? - 0.40 |0.30 - 0.60 |- |Standard ghost |0.08 - 0.30 |0.10 - 0.92 |0.30 - 1.00 |}<small>*Note: values for Deogen are measured values and may not be accurate.</small> ==Strengths and weaknesses== These are the strengths and weaknesses as listed in the journal: Strength: Deogens constantly sense the living. You can run but you can't hide. Weakness: Deogens require a lot of energy to form and will move very slowly when approaching its victim. ==Evidence== On difficulties with only 1 or 2 evidences (e.g. Nightmare), the Deogen always has Spirit Box as one of its pieces of evidence due to its unique response. ==Strategies== ===Hunt=== If you have not ruled the Deogen out, it is best to choose a hiding spot which you can easily leave before the Deogen corners you, or have Incense prepared. Once a Deogen is close enough to the player for its weakness to kick in, it becomes the slowest ghost in the game. Provided players do not accidentally trap themselves in a tight space with no way out, surviving a Deogen is trivial as it is impossible for it to catch up to its targets so long as they keep moving, as it becomes extremely slow, much slower than the player's default movement speed, and can be extremely easily looped; on bigger maps such as Sunny Meadows or Brownstone High School, the player might not even have to loop it, and can simply walk around the map and lead it on a tour (as long as they don't accidentally go into a dead end). It is worth noting that when the Deogen is stunned with smudge sticks, it will maintain the speed at it was at when affected; in most cases, the Deogen will be moving at its minimum speed, meaning that the Deogen will only roam a very short distance before being able to chase players again. When playing in multiplayer, keep server lag in mind; if you misjudge the ghost's server-side position and move away too late, it may kill you. To avoid this, try not to cut it too close with looping and moving around the ghost especially if your connection is poor, and stay a moderate distance away; Since the Deogen only switches targets periodically and not in real time based on distance, avoid having players stand behind each other to prevent the Deogen from rushing into another player to reach its target, because the Deogen can kill non-targets unlike the Banshee. ===Identification=== The most straightforward form of identification is for the ghost to hunt and reveal its dramatically different hunting behaviour; if it approaches the nearest player at high speeds and slows down drastically as it approaches, then it is a Deogen. Note that a \"young\" Thaye, a Revenant that has detected someone, and a Hantu when the power has been out for a while and room temperatures are at their lowest, may move at similar speeds, but without slowing down drastically (if at all); mistaking them for a Deogen can be deadly. A non-hunt way would be to constantly track the ghost and look for the signature heavy breathing through the spirit box, though this will be more tedious, especially in large rooms. The easiest way to do this is using a Tier III Motion Sensor; because the spherical radius of the sensor is only slightly larger than the distance required to obtain heavy breathing, using the Spirit Box on top of the Motion Sensor when it triggers has a good chance of producing the unique Deogen response. ===Miscellaneous=== Deogens are among the easiest ghosts to take a ghost photo of, partly due to being invisible for shorter and visible for longer, and partly due to their hunt mechanics making them easily looped, giving players plenty of time to snap a photo; keep a photo camera handy if needed. If the player has to temporarily step away from an ongoing game for whatever reason, remember to move outside the investigation area before stepping away; staying in a hiding spot will not work against a Deogen, which will find and kill the player when it starts hunting. ==Trivia== *The ghost is based on the \"De Ogen\", a Flemish tale about a strange yellow-eyed fog haunting the Sonian Forest in Belgium. However, there is no evidence this tale even exists, as the only source for its existence was made-up as an Internet hoax. *Because the Deogen always has line-of-sight with all players, most \"safe spots\" that take advantage of a lack of line-of-sight will not work, resulting in death. In fact, this may also result in the Deogen killing players through walls that are sufficiently thin. *The Deogen cannot be the ghost selected for the contract if the lobby's host is below Prestige 0 Level 30. This is due to the Deogen's hunt mechanics being so drastically different from other ghosts that new players still learning the hunt mechanics would be too confused by it. **This piece of information was first shared by u/BigMeikLIVE on the Phasmophobia subreddit then tested by some people before Trial Moderator Skreekaw on the Discord server ultimately got confirmation by Lead Developer Dknighter on 11 November 2024. **The Mimic can still, however, imitate the Deogen before Prestige 0 Level 30. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !0.6.2.0 |Added Deogen. |- !0.6.2.1 |Updated Deogen weakness description to stop some confusion. |- !0.9.0 |The Deogen no longer has an increased chance to interact with the D.O.T.S.

{"content":"<div class=\"mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"width:400px; margin-left:1%; float:right; text-align:right\"> <span style=\"color:#efcf00\">This image has flashing lights.</span><div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\"></div> </div> The hunt is an in-game mechanic intended to complicate further investigation of a location by the player(s). During hunts, the ghost will materialize itself and proceed to roam around the location in order to kill one or more players. For the duration of the hunt, all exit doors will become locked and the ghost will cause all nearby lights and electronic equipment to malfunction. A cursed hunt is a variant of a hunt caused by cursed possessions. Mechanic-wise, cursed hunts are mostly similar to regular hunts. ==Initiating a hunt== ===Standard protections=== Hunts cannot occur while the setup phase is ongoing. The duration of the setup phase by difficulty is as follows: {| class=\"article-table\" !Difficulty !Duration of setup phase |- |Amateur |5 minutes |- |Intermediate |2 minutes |- |Professional<br>Nightmare<br>Insanity |No setup phase |} The setup phase can be ended early if a cursed possession is used or activated. Once a hunt ends, there is a minimum cooldown of 25 seconds (20 seconds for a Demon) before the ghost can attempt to initiate another hunt. This does not affect the activation of cursed hunts. Ghosts do not necessarily hunt immediately once this cooldown is over. ===Regular hunt requirements=== At least one player must be within the investigation area for a hunt to begin. All ghosts have a sanity hunt threshold below which they will be able to hunt, and some ghosts may have abilities which may modify the threshold, or even override it entirely. Using \"trigger words\" or swearing does not increase the chance of a hunt. ====Hunt sanity thresholds==== For most ghosts, the average team sanity is used to determine whether the ghost can hunt. The average sanity is of all players who are alive, regardless of whether they are inside or outside the investigation area. Dead players do not count towards the average team sanity. For most ghosts, the hunt sanity threshold is 50%; ghosts can choose to initiate hunts at random once the average sanity is at or below 50%. Generally, a lower average sanity increases the frequency of hunts, but other factors may affect this. The following table lists the hunt sanity thresholds and abilities for all ghosts: {| class=\"article-table\" style=\"margin: auto;\" !Ghost !Condition !Hunt sanity threshold<br>(if non-standard) (%) !Non-threshold based ability/<br>additional notes |- |Banshee |Always |Standard |Only checks target's sanity |- | rowspan=\"2\" |Dayan |When a nearby player is moving |65 | |- |When a nearby player is still |45 | |- | rowspan=\"2\" |Demon |On ability phase activation |N/A |Hunts regardless of sanity<br>Can use its ability during the setup phase, but it will not hunt. |- |Always |70 | |- |Deogen |Always |40 | |- | rowspan=\"2\" |Gallu |In \"enraged\" state |60 | |- |In \"weakened\" state |40 | |- | rowspan=\"2\" |Mare |Lights turned off or broken at ghost's current room |60 | |- |Lights turned on at ghost's current room |40 |Regardless of fuse box status |- | rowspan=\"2\"|Obambo |In \"aggressive\" state |65 | |- |In \"calm\" state |10 | |- | rowspan=\"3\" |Onryo |Every third flame blown out and no other flame nearby |N/A |Hunts regardless of sanity |- |Always |60 | |- |Near a flame |40 | |- |Raiju |In the presence of active electronic equipment |65 | |- | rowspan=\"2\" |Shade |Always |35 | |- |At least one player in ghost's current room |N/A |Does not hunt regardless of sanity |- | rowspan=\"3\" |Thaye |Initial threshold (Age 0) |75 | |- |Modifier per age added (Age +1) | -6 | |- |Final threshold (Age 10) |15 | |- |The Mimic | colspan=\"3\" |Inherits hunt thresholds & abilities of currently-mimicked ghost |- |Yokai |At least one player uses voice chat nearby |80 | |- |All other ghosts/<br>standard |Always |50 | |} ===Cursed hunts=== Cursed hunts can only be initiated directly by using cursed possessions. Cursed hunts ignore sanity thresholds and hunt cooldowns; they can start right after a normal hunt, but normal hunts respect the cooldown after cursed hunts. Cancelled cursed hunts (due to empty locations) don't count toward the cooldown timer. ===Activity=== During hunts, the activity monitor shows level 10. However, activity level doesn't indicate hunting probability, and level 10 readings don't always mean a hunt is occurring. ===Preventing a hunt=== Hunt prevention equipment: *Crucifix: Stops hunts if ghost is within range when attempting to hunt. Ghost must wait 25 seconds (20 for Demon) before trying again. Tier I prevents 1 hunt; Tiers II and III prevent 2 hunts. *Fire sources: A lit fire source, such as a firelight or a campfire, within 4 meters of an Onryo prevents hunting, but the Onryo can blow out flames, potentially triggering a hunt regardless of sanity. *Incense: Prevents hunt initiation for varying durations when lit within 3-5 meters (tier-dependent) of the ghost: **Demon: 60 seconds **Spirit: 180 seconds **All other ghosts: 90 seconds *Monkey Paw: \"I wish to trap the ghost\" prevents hunting for 1 minute but triggers a guaranteed hunt immediately afterward. Cursed hunts can only be prevented by a tier III crucifix with two charges remaining. Incense blinds ghosts during cursed hunts but won't prevent them. ==Start of a hunt== Each hunt consists of a grace period (not to be confused with the cooldown between hunts) and the actual hunting phase. During the grace period, the ghost will remain invisible and still for a number of seconds, giving players a chance to escape before it begins chasing them. All exit doors lock at the beginning of the grace period, preventing players from entering or exiting the investigation area. The duration of this grace period depends on difficulty or the type of the hunt: *Amateur: 5 seconds *Intermediate: 4 seconds *Professional: 3 seconds *Nightmare: 2 seconds *Insanity: 2 seconds *Cursed hunt: 1 second *Custom: 0 - 5 seconds The ghost cannot detect or see players during this grace period. Subsequent hunts after a cursed hunt, where not activated by a cursed possession again, are not \"true\" cursed hunts and hence revert to the difficulty-based grace period. The duration of a hunt depends on the difficulty and the map size. These are as follows, excluding the grace period: {| class=\"article-table\" style=\"margin: auto;\" ! rowspan=\"2\" |Difficulty ! colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |Duration of hunt |- !Small map !Medium map !Large map |- |Amateur<br>Hunt duration: Low |15 seconds |30 seconds |40 seconds |- |Intermediate<br>Hunt duration: Medium |20 seconds |40 seconds |50 seconds |- |Professional<br>Nightmare<br>Insanity<br>Hunt duration: High |30 seconds |50 seconds |1 minute |}<br>After a cursed hunt is initiated, all subsequent hunts in the same contract, whether regular or cursed, including the ongoing cursed hunt, will last 20 seconds longer than the original duration. The hunt duration is the same for all ghosts. If the Kills extend hunts setting is not off, each successful kill will extend the current hunt duration: {| class=\"article-table\" style=\"margin: auto;\" ! rowspan=\"2\" |Difficulty ! colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Added duration |- !Small map !Medium map !Large map |- |Nightmare<br>Insanity<br>Kills extend hunts: Low |15 seconds |20 seconds |25 seconds |- |Kills extend hunts: Medium |25 seconds |30 seconds |35 seconds |- |Kills extend hunts: High |35 seconds |40 seconds |45 seconds |} <br>Using the Monkey Paw's \"I wish to leave\" wish will unlock all exit doors even during a hunt, but with temporary side effects. Hunts always initiate from wherever the ghost is standing (except for The Twins in specific cases); it does not have to start from any specific room. Once the grace period begins, an EMF 4 signal will be emitted at the point where the ghost is standing. ==Ghost movement== Once the grace period ends, the ghost will proceed to either wander in a random direction, or chase a player. Ghosts cannot teleport during hunts. Within the investigation area, the ghost is able to access practically all places that players can access. It may also phase through certain furniture such as doors, some beds, and some clutter. The ghost cannot physically enter closets, lockers and mini tents, though it can stand in front of (and appear to be partially inside) one. ===Wandering=== In a \"wandering\" (or \"roaming\") phase where the ghost is not aware of any player, the ghost randomly selects a waypoint on the map, moves to that waypoint, then repeats. The ghost always attempts to take the shortest path to its waypoint. ===Chasing phase=== If the ghost detects a player, its \"wandering\" phase will be disrupted and it will enter a \"chasing\" phase, setting a waypoint at the player's last known location. If it reaches the waypoint, it will repeat this action until it is unable to detect any player, upon which it will search in the immediate vicinity, before returning to its \"wandering\" phase. If multiple players are detected at the same time (such as a Deogen which immediately detects all players after the grace period ends), it will set a waypoint at the nearest player by straight-line distance. The following actions attract the ghost: ;Being seen by the ghost *Each player has a total of 6 tracking points, split into 2 groups of 3, each on the upper and lower parts of the hitbox. This is anchored to the player's current point-of-view. The ghost is considered to be able to see the player, or achieving line-of-sight (LoS), if it can see all 3 points of one group (e.g. seeing 2 upper group points and 2 lower group points does not count). The placement of these tracking points means that having the head poke through a closed closet will not allow the ghost to see non-VR players, but VR players could possibly be seen, since they are actually looking through the closet. *The ghost has a 360-degree vision. *The ghost can see players up to 75 meters away. *Each ghost model has the same \"head\" height. If the ghost is a crawling model, LoS will still be achieved as if the ghost was standing. *Most physical objects or structures, except throwable objects, will block LoS. This includes glass windows and doors, and cell walls and doors in Prison. ;Voice communications *During a hunt, ghosts can hear players up to 9 meters away on the same floor. *Whether the ghost can hear the player is dictated by their voice chat settings. When voice chat is activated, any sound above a certain volume, whether from the player talking or background noise, will attract the ghost within the specified distance. *Using global chat within 9 meters of the ghost, even without talking, will attract it to the player using it. This does not attract the ghost to other players; players outside the investigation area using global chat will not cause players inside to die. ;Active electronic equipment *The ghost will be attracted by any active electronic equipment held by players in their hand, placed on the VR toolbelt, or being worn on their head, within 7.5 meters of it on the same floor during a hunt. Items that do not make any noise such as flashlights or thermometers will still attract the ghost. Regular flashlights (but not UV flashlights) that are swapped into the inventory but still turned on will also attract the ghost. *Equipment dropped on the floor or offhand, as well as deactivated Head Gear that is still being worn, do not attract the ghost. *The player model always has a default, short shoulder flashlight (different from the ones collected from the truck wall). This small flashlight is always turned on and does not attract the ghost. For comparison, the normal electronic interference range is 10 meters. Voice communication and electronic detection are similar in terms of detection priority. If the ghost is considered to be on a different floor from the player, the ghost can only detect the player through LoS. Otherwise, the ghost will not be able to detect the player through other methods. The following do not attract the ghost: *Footsteps; *Door, closet and locker noises; *Electronics on the floor, even when turned on; *Electronics that are held and turned off; *Crucifixes; *Lit incense; *Firelights and glowsticks, even when lit; *Players outside the investigation area (except Deogen in some cases). ====Special detection cases==== =====Waypoint memory between hunts===== During the hunt, the ghost will remember the last seen location of a player before the hunt ended. When a new hunt starts, the ghost first has a 50% chance to set a waypoint at this location. This may include the location of a player it killed. If there is no such instance or otherwise, the ghost will \"forget\" this location and proceed with either regular wandering or chasing. *This is not relevant when the ghost is not hunting; the ghost does not remember player locations outside of a hunt. It is theoretically safe to hide in a closet or locker indefinitely if the doors remain closed and the player avoids being seen, since ghosts cannot walk into them. *The ghost can only remember one waypoint per hunt; the same waypoint does not carry across multiple hunts. =====Detection in hiding spots with doors===== If the player is detected in a closet, locker, or small tent, the ghost will set a waypoint just outside that location, then force open the door(s) of that hiding spot when it arrives, overriding the player holding the door if applicable. This usually results in death unless the player is standing in such a way that delays LoS from being achieved, and they can close the closet door again fast enough. =====Hiding behind opened room doors===== If there is an opened room door in the ghost's interaction range, it will check if there are players nearby. If this is true, it will roam to the player's location and forcefully close the door, similar to how ghosts open closet/locker doors if a player is detected inside. =====Smudging===== If the ghost is within range of a burning Incense, regardless of who is holding the Incense, and is successfully \"pinged\", the ghost will be unable to detect or kill players for 5 seconds, causing it to enter the \"wandering\" phase. When the effect ends, it will be able to detect and kill players again, resuming its normal hunting behaviour. The Incense technically does not \"repel\" the ghost away from the player, only that it will randomly set a new waypoint which may or may not be in the same direction as the player. =====Monkey Paw===== Using the Monkey Paw's \"I wish to be safe\" will enable the ghost to detect the wisher's voice and electronics from infinite range (including from different floors) for the rest of the contract. =====Ghost-specific detection behaviours===== Some ghosts have different behaviours in terms of detecting players during hunts: *If the Banshee's target is currently within the investigation area, it cannot detect nor kill non-targets. *The Deogen always has LoS with all players, meaning it always knows everyone's location. *Blinding the Moroi using Incense is effective for 50% longer. *The Yokai can only detect voices and electronics within 2.5 meters of it, instead of the respective 9 and 7.5 metres. ===Ghost speeds=== <small>The speeds listed below assume a default Ghost speed (%) setting of 100. The speeds will scale accordingly if this setting is changed.</small> Most ghosts move at a base speed of 1.7 m/s. If a ghost maintains active line-of-sight (LoS) with a player it is chasing, its speed will gradually increase at a rate of 0.05 times its base speed per second, taking up to 13 seconds to reach the cap of 1.65 times its base speed. If it loses detection of a player, it will maintain the speed until it gives up its \"immediate area search\", thereafter slowly decreasing its speed at 0.01 times its base speed per second. This takes 65 seconds to return to base speed if from maximum speed. Ghosts do not carry over their speed across hunts. The following ghosts obey LoS, but have additional modifiers that may or may not conditionally override it: *The Dayan moves at a fixed speed of 2.25 m/s (overriding LoS acceleration) if a player is moving within 10 metres, or at a fixed speed of 1.2 m/s (also overriding LoS acceleration) if the player is standing still within 10 metres. It obeys normal ghost speeds if there is no player within 10 metres. *The Jinn moves at a fixed speed of 2.5 m/s (overriding LoS acceleration) if it has LoS with a player, that player is further than 3 meters away, and the fuse box is on. It obeys normal ghost speeds if any of these conditions are not met. *The Raiju moves at a fixed speed of 2.5 m/s (overriding LoS acceleration) if it is within a certain distance of any active electronic equipment. It obeys normal speeds outside of the radius. The following ghosts ignore standard LoS speed rules: *The Deogen moves slower the shorter its pathing distance is to the player; its speed ranges from 0.4 m/s (within 2.5 meters of the player) to 3 m/s (further than 6 meters). If it is not chasing anyone (e.g. when smudged), it stays at its previous speed, or 1.6 m/s if its previous speed was higher than 3 m/s. *The Hantu's speed increases the lower the room temperature is, going from a minimum of 1.4 m/s to a maximum of 2.7 m/s. *The Revenant moves at 1 m/s if it has not detected any player. If it detects a player, it will move at 3 m/s until it reaches the last known position of the player, before decelerating at a rate of 0.75 m/s² (for ~2.7 s) back to 1 m/s. *The Thaye's speed is fixed at 2.75 m/s initially. Every time it ages, this speed decreases by 0.175 m/s; it will reach 1 m/s once it has aged completely.<ref name=\"24_patch\" /> Additionally, if the weather is Blood Moon, the ghost's speed is increased by 15%. For comparison, the player walks at 1.6 m/s and can sprint at 3 m/s for 3 seconds with a 5-second cooldown, resulting in an average speed of 2.125 m/s if continuously sprinting off-cooldown. ==Interacting with objects== Ghosts are able to perform interactions during hunts. There are similarities and differences from non-hunt interactions: *All ghosts have a 50% chance (100% chance for Poltergeist) of throwing one object near them (within their interaction range) every 0.5 seconds during hunts, 4 seconds after the beginning of the hunt. *Ghosts can interact with all types of doors, except exit doors and other types of furniture doors. If a ghost with the Ultraviolet evidence interacts with a door, it will leave the evidence accordingly. **If the player is holding a normal or closet door, the ghost cannot override it unless it detects the player as defined above. It can still leave an EMF signal and Ultraviolet (if applicable) if it cannot override the door. **Ghosts cannot randomly interact with small tent (hiding) doors but will do so if a player is detected in the small tent. *The ghost can blow out firelights within 5 meters during a hunt, though this is technically not a true interaction. Most other objects cannot be interacted with by the ghost during a hunt. ==Other hunt-related behaviour== During hunts, the ghost will always produce footsteps and one specific vocalization that is used for all hunts in that contract. The interval between footsteps depends on the moving speed of the ghost. Without adjusting for volume fall-off, the maximum distance a player can hear ghost footsteps and vocalizations during a hunt is 20 meters (12 meters for Myling). If the player(s) and the ghost are located on different floors during the hunt, there will be no electronic interference and the ghost's footsteps and vocalizations will be greatly muffled, though the range is still the same. Sound occlusion and electronic interference does not account for physics; a ghost going up a staircase may sound muffled and not cause electronic interference on the upper floor until it reaches the top, for example. Within 10 meters of the ghost (15 meters for Raiju), all active electronic equipment and map lights, as well as global chat, will malfunction and/or flicker rapidly. Players can hear their own heartbeat if the ghost is within 10 meters, and there are no walls, floors, or doors between the ghost and the player, and the closer the ghost is to the player, the louder the heartbeats. Most, if not all pieces of furniture do not prevent heartbeats even when the ghost technically does not have line-of-sight with the player. During a hunt, the ghost will flicker or flash in and out of existence. The first flicker-in occurs immediately when the grace period ends. The following shows the flickering rates of various ghosts: {| class=\"fandom-table\" !Ghost !Visibility length (s) !Invisibility length (s) !Total per-flicker length (s) !Average visibility compared to standard ghost |- |Standard |0.08 - 0.30 |0.10 - 0.92 |0.30 - 1.00 |N/A |- |Deogen* |0.20 - 0.30 |0.01? - 0.40 |0.30 - 0.60 |More visible/less invisible |- |Oni* |0.02? - 0.50 |0.01? - 0.50? |0.30? - 1.00? |More visible/less invisible |- |Phantom |0.08 - 0.30 |0.70 - 1.92 |1.00 - 2.00 |More invisible/less visible |}<small>*Note: values for Deogen and Oni are measured values and may not be accurate.</small><br>The total per-flicker length refers to the time between two consecutive flicker-ins, i.e. the total duration of 1 set of the ghost being visible and then invisible, in that order. The visibility length and invisibility length added together will not exceed the total per-flicker length. For example, if a normal ghost has a visibility length of 0.30 seconds in 1 set, the invisibility length in that same set will not exceed 0.70 seconds (the total not exceeding 1 second). In addition, the Obake occasionally shapeshifts into a different ghost model on one flicker-in, before returning to its normal model on the following flicker-in. Timed correctly, one can obtain Ghost photos during a hunt while the ghost flashes visible. The hunt also allows for Hunting Ghost videos and sounds to be obtained. ==Dying== For the ghost to kill a player, their \"collision boxes\" must intersect, and line-of-sight must be achieved. When the ghost kills a player, the player will drop all of their equipment and grotesque hands will appear on their screen before they are teleported into an otherworldly room alone with the ghost. The dead player will then return to their location with their entire screen covered in bright fog. From another player's perspective, the victim drops their equipment and reaches for their neck as they're being strangled by an invisible force, before dropping dead. One dead player chosen at random can be revived if a tarot card labeled The High Priestess is drawn or if the Monkey Paw's \"I wish for life\" wish is used with a 50% chance of killing the wishing player. If all players die, the contract will end. ==End of a hunt== A hunt ends when the ghost successfully kills a player (when Kills extend hunts is off), the ghost's hunting time is up, or there are no alive players within the investigation area for any reason, including if every player is killed, if every player glitches out at the start of a hunt/during a hunt, or if the exit doors are unlocked with the Monkey Paw's \"I wish to leave\" wish and every player exits during a hunt. When the hunt ends, the ghost will disappear and be teleported back to its ghost room, the exit door can be unlocked again, all on-site lights will turn off and can once again be toggled. ==Related difficulty settings== *Ghost speed (%): How quickly the ghost moves *Friendly ghost: The ghost will never hunt. Turning this setting on will result in zero rewards *Grace period (s): The duration before the ghost can kill you at the start of a hunt *Hunt duration (s): The duration the ghost will hunt for *Kills extend hunts (s): The time added to the hunt duration when killing a player *Setup time (s): How long before the ghost can start a hunt ==Trivia== *Hunts do not count toward witnessing a ghost event. *The number of hunts during a given game will appear on the resume screen in the lobby. *It is possible for a hunt to start without any players inside the investigation area; when a player stands perfectly in an exit doorway, it's possible for a hunt to start, as the game thinks they are inside the investigation area, but with the player getting pushed outwards and out of the investigation area when the doorway is blocked. If this happens, the hunt will immediately end. ==See also== *Guides/Surviving a hunt *Guides/Identifying ghosts *Guides/Common misconceptions ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access Alpha |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |2 February 2020 |Doubled the hunt duration. |- |Ghosts now have a higher chance of teleporting if it cannot find players while hunting. |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |5 March 2020 |Global chat is now unusable during hunts. |- |Ghosts will now flash in and out during hunts. |- !10 March 2020 |Ghosts will no longer teleport while hunting on smaller maps. |- ! 19 March 2020 |Added a grace period of 3 seconds to the start of the hunt. |- !23 March 2020<br>(Part 2) |Ghosts now flash at a faster rate during hunts. |- ! rowspan=\"3\" |23 March 2020<br>(Part 3) |Ghosts now appear for longer during hunts. |- |All exit doors are now locked during hunts and cannot be unlocked until after the hunt. |- |Ghosts now emit footstep sounds during hunts. |- ! 25 March 2020<br>(Part 2) |Hunts now cause the Site Activity Monitor to show at level 10. |- !30 March 2020 |Reduced the hunt duration. |- !31 March 2020 |Hunts will no longer initiate if no one is inside the building. |- !8 April 2020 |Added a 15 second cooldown between hunts. |- !26 April 2020 |Flashlights will now flicker during hunts. |- !30 July 2020<br>(Part 2) |Lights will now turn off while the ghost is in the room during a hunt. |- !15 August 2020<br>(Part 3) |The ghost is now invisible during the grace period at the start of a hunt. |- !17 August 2020<br>(Part 2) |Increased the cooldown between hunts to 25 seconds. |- !22 August 2020 |Heartbeats will now play when looking at the ghost while it is invisible during hunts. |- !3 September 2020<br>(Part 2) |The ghost now appears for longer when flashing during hunts. |- !10 September 2020 |Ghosts will now teleport back to the ghost room after a hunt. |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !22 September 2020 |Increased the grace period to 8 seconds. |- ! rowspan=\"6\" |0.28.6.5 |Decreased the grace period to 5 seconds. |- |Ghosts no longer move during the hunt's starting grace period. |- |Ghosts now accelerate or decelerate depending on whether they see a player. |- |Ghosts now have a chance to remember the last seen location of a player. |- |Ghosts now open both locker doors slightly as a chance or to kill players. |- |Furniture now blocks line-of-sight. |- ! rowspan=\"6\" | 0.3.0 |The flickering animation for flashlights during hunts has been changed. |- |All electronics now flicker during hunts, instead of only some. |- |Electronics now only flicker within a certain radius of the ghost. |- |Most electronics now attract the ghost during hunts. |- |Decreased the grace period to 3 seconds. |- |Global chat now works outside of the electronic interference range. |- !0.3.0.1 |Increased the grace period to 4 seconds. |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |0.4.0 |The hunt duration is now variable based on map size. |- |The grace period is now variable based on difficulty. |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |0.5.0 |Ghosts can now throw objects during hunts. |- |Added cursed hunts. |- !0.6.1.0 |Ghosts can now check behind doors. |- !0.6.2.1 |Ghosts no longer emit footsteps while standing still during the grace period. |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |0.7.0 |Reduced the audible range of ghost vocalisations from unlimited to 20 metres. |- |Increased the rate of interacting with objects during hunts to 50% every 0.5 seconds. |} ==References== ==Notes== ru:Охота fr:Chasse<!-- zh:猎杀--> Category:Ghost State","title":"Hunt","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Hunt"}

The amount of XP earned each contract is displayed on the debriefing screen. ===Gaining experience=== Players may gain XP from the following sources: {| class=\"article-table mw-collapsible\" !Task completed !colspan=\"2\"|XP rewarded |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Ghost identification |Small map |100 XP |- |Medium map |150 XP |- |Large map |200 XP |- |Objectives 1 - 3 |colspan=\"2\"|25 - 30 XP per successful objective |- |Media |colspan=\"2\"|Up to 231 XP |- |Investigation Bonus |colspan=\"2\"|If the player identifies the correct ghost and escapes alive, XP = Ghost identification + Completed objectives |- |Perfect Investigation Bonus |colspan=\"2\"|50 XP on top of Investigation Bonus |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Bone Evidence |Small map |25 XP |- |Medium map |35 XP |- |Large map |50 XP |- |Blood Moon weather |colspan=\"2\"|+10% |} To get the additional Perfect Investigation Bonus of 50 XP, the player must identify the correct ghost, complete all 3 objectives, collect the bone, and fill the journal with only unique media. The amount of experience gained from identifying the ghost, completing optional objectives, recorded media, and any investigation bonus(es) is then multiplied by the difficulty multiplier: *Amateur: 1x *Intermediate: 2x *Professional: 3x *Nightmare: 4x *Insanity: 6x *Custom: 0x - 15x depending on settings If the player does not identify the correct ghost on a custom difficulty, their rewards will be rounded down to the nearest default difficulty (e.g. from 7x to 6x, which is the Insanity multiplier). Difficulty multipliers below 1x are not affected. If the player is dead when the investigation ends, the difficulty multiplier is not applied if it is higher than 1x, and their experience gained is halved. If the resulting EXP is not an integer value, it is then rounded down to the nearest integer. ===Level progression=== Players will unlock more equipment, difficulty levels, and maps as they progress. Prestige level doesn't change the amount of EXP for level up. {| class=\"mw-collapsible mw-collapsed fandom-table\" !colspan=\"4\"|Level progression details |- !Level !XP to Next Level !Cumulative XP to Reach This Level !Unlocks |- |1 |100 |0 | |- |2 |231 |100 | *10 Ridgeview Court *42 Edgefield Road *Photo Camera Tier 1 |- |3 |337 |331 | *Motion Sensor Tier 1 |- |4 |432 |668 | *Bleasdale Farmhouse *Grafton Farmhouse *Sound Recorder Tier 1 |- |5 |518 |1,100 | *Nell's Diner *Parabolic Microphone Tier 1 |- |6 |601 |1,618 | *13 Willow Street |- |7 |678 |2,219 | *Crucifix Tier 1 |- |8 |753 |2,897 | *Brownstone High School *Salt Tier 1 |- |9 |825 |3,650 | *Tripod Tier 1 |- |10 |895 |4,475 | *Intermediate difficulty *Sound Sensor Tier 1 |- |11 |962 |5,370 | *Prison |- |12 |1,029 |6,332 | *Firelight Tier 1 *Igniter Tier 1 |- |13 |1,094 |7,361 | *Camp Woodwind *Maple Lodge Campsite *Head Gear Tier 1 |- |14 |1,156 |8,455 | *Incense Tier 1 *Sanity Medication Tier 1 |- |15 |1,219 |9,611 | *Point Hope |- |16 |1,279 |10,830 | |- |17 |1,339 |12,109 | *Sunny Meadows Mental Institution/Restricted |- |18 |1,398 |13,448 | *Flashlight Tier 2 *EMF Reader Tier 2 *UV Light Tier 2 |- |19 |1,456 |14,846 | |- |20 |1,512 |16,302 | *Professional difficulty |- |21 |1,569 |17,814 | |- |22 |1,625 |19,383 | |- |23 |1,679 |21,008 | *Ghost Writing Book Tier 2 *Photo Camera Tier 2 *Spirit Box Tier 2 |- |24 |1,734 |22,687 | |- |25 |1,787 |24,421 | |- |26 |1,840 |26,208 | |- |27 |1,892 |28,048 | *D.O.T.S.

{"content":"Dirty water is murky brown water that appears in sinks, triggered by a ghost. This can be useful as an indicator for the ghost's general location. ==Mechanics== ]] If a ghost interacts with a nearby sink, it will cause the sink to start filling with brown-coloured water, or turn the water brown if a player had already activated the sink prior. An EMF level 2 emission will spawn on the sink's location, with a 33% chance for this to be EMF Level 5 instead if it is one of the ghost's evidences. Whether the sink has been activated before does not affect the ghost's ability to form dirty water. The sink cannot be emptied or cleaned once it has started filling with water, whether plain or dirty. ===Rewards=== Taking a photo of dirty water or filming the faucet being opened by the ghost will yield a photo or a video labelled as Dirty Water, and reward up to $7 and 7 XP, depending on the equipment tier and whether there is a Unique stamp. A dirty water photo can only be obtained once per sink, but dirty water videos can be obtained for multiple interactions on the same sink. ==Tips== ===Reliability=== As dirty water requires the ghost to be physically near a sink and interact with it, obtaining dirty water tends to be unreliable; in most maps, only a few rooms or small parts of the map have sinks. Clearing the room of interactable items will increase the chance of the ghost interacting with the sink. Depending on where the ghost is and the difficulty settings, it may not be worth it to wait for dirty water to appear. ===Interacting with the faucet=== It is advised to turn off the sink after the player is done filling it, in order to hear it turn on again should the ghost interact with it. ==Trivia== *Capturing a photo of dirty water was once a possible optional objective. This was later removed because of the unreliability in completing this objective. *In the promotional video on Steam for the game, the investigator turns on a sink and dirty water comes out. He tells his friend on the walkie, and his friend responds \"That means we're dealing with a Spirit or a Wraith.\" This was changed before the game was made available on Steam and dirty water currently does not serve as evidence for any particular ghost type. ==See also== *Photo Camera *Objectives Category:Objectives fr:Eau sale","title":"Dirty Water","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Dirty_Water"}
{"content":"The Demon is a type of ghost in Phasmophobia. Demons are generally considered to be one of the most dangerous types of ghost to encounter: they are purported to attack more often than any other ghost. == Behaviour == === Ability === The Demon has an ability that allows it to automatically start a hunt, regardless of current average sanity. There is no particular behaviour or condition (such as requiring line-of-sight with a player) that affects if it activates or not; if it decides to use its ability, it will hunt. This hunt can be blocked by normal prevention methods. Because the Demon's ability hunt is governed by the \"ability phase\", these hunts occur much less frequently than hunts derived from being below its sanity threshold. Additionally, as this is not a \"proper\" hunt attempt, the Demon can attempt to use its ability when it is unable to hunt (during the setup phase on Amateur and Intermediate difficulties, when it is affected by Incense, or when a hunt has just ended and it is on cooldown). However, it will fail and there will be no hunt. === Hunt === The Demon has a normal hunt sanity threshold of 70%, instead of the standard 50%. This does not affect and is independent from its hunt ability, although the hunt does not differ in any way. Demons have a minimum cooldown of 20 seconds between hunts, instead of the usual 25 seconds. Smudging a Demon will prevent hunts for only 60 seconds, as opposed to the standard 90 seconds. As a weakness, the effective range of a crucifix is 50% larger than the standard range: * 4.5 metres instead of 3 for Tier I * 6 metres instead of 4 for Tier II * 7.5 metres instead of 5 for Tier III == Evidence == == Strengths and weaknesses == These are the strengths and weaknesses as listed in the journal: Strength: Demons will initiate hunts more often than other ghosts. Weakness: Demons fear the Crucifix and will be less aggressive near one. == Strategies== Generally, it is best to think of the Demon as having a 100% hunt sanity threshold, even if its hunts are rarer above 70% average sanity. To identify a Demon by its traits, players may time the cooldown between hunts, or watch out for signs of a very early hunt. Given the Demon's relative aggressiveness in hunting, players should plan their route to the ghost room and what they wish to bring for any objectives, while considering whether to hide or to use Incense on the ghost if it hunts. Sprint may need to be conserved once approaching the ghost room in order to make a quick escape in the event of a sudden hunt. If a very early hunt occurs, make sure to rule out the possibility of a cursed hunt caused by another player using a cursed possession without the rest of the team's knowledge. With the crucifix's increased effective range, preventing hunts will generally be easier, though difficulties may still be encountered in massive rooms, such as the Basketball Court of Brownstone High School. === Identification === Players can use two tests: * Time the hunt cooldown: a cooldown of less than 25 seconds (excluding hunts caused by cursed possessions) may indicate a Demon. If it uses a crucifix charge in this time, this may also be indicative of a Demon. * Time the smudge hunt prevention: a ghost hunting between 60 - 90 seconds after being smudged correctly may indicate a Demon Take care to ensure that the timing is correct to avoid misidentification -- usage of a stopwatch may be helpful. In particular, if a ghost is still under the effect of a previous smudge, smudging again will not reset the timer, which may throw off timing; wait for the ghost to attempt another hunt before smudging again. Note that ghosts do not necessarily hunt after the cooldown is over; having hunts consistently being more than 25 seconds apart does not necessarily eliminate the Demon as a possibility. Additionally, while a ghost hunting above 70% average sanity is very likely to be a Demon, this does not guarantee it, as a few other ghosts are also capable of hunting that early. However, a Demon will do this the most consistently, as these other ghosts have conditions on hunting at high levels of sanity (the Yokai requires talking, the Onryo requires firelights to be blown out, etc.). ==Trivia== *On 42 Edgefield Road, a Demon located in the Garage, Master Bedroom, or Hallway may be able to burn a crucifix which is still hanging in the truck, as its increased range covers portions of these rooms. Note that it is also possible for this to happen with other ghosts (especially with higher crucifix tiers which have a longer range), but the Demon is able to do this much more frequently. *In mythology, demons tend to have horrifying forms, being commonly depicted with horns, tails, claws, and other inhuman appendages. In-game, Demons draw from the regular pool of Ghost Models without any sort of modifications. *The word \"demon\" comes from Ancient Greek \"δαίμων\" (daimōn), meaning \"god\", \"godlike\", \"power\", \"fate\", etc. It was used in contexts related to unknown/supernatural forces, both good and bad. As time progressed, the meaning became more negative thanks to Christianization. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" | Early Access Alpha |- ! 5 August 2020 | Added Demon. |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- ! 0.29.6 | Increased the hunt sanity threshold from 65% to 70%. |- ! 0.3.0 | Prior to 0.3.0, the evidence was Spirit Box, Ghost Writing, and Freezing Temperatures. |- ! 0.4.0 | Demons now deduct less sanity on successful questions instead of failed questions. |- ! rowspan=\"3\" | 0.5.0 | The Banshee's rare ability to hunt at any sanity percentage has been moved to the Demon. |- | The Demon's hunt cooldown is now 20 seconds. |- | Smudge sticks now prevent the Demon from hunting for only 60 seconds instead of 90 seconds. |- ! 0.5.1.0 | The Demon's reduced sanity drop now applies to all cursed possessions. |- !0.5.2.0 | The Demon's weakness has been changed from reducing cursed possession sanity drops to having a larger crucifix range, which was originally the Banshee's weakness. |- !0.7.0 | Improved the reliability of the Demon's hunt ability. |- !0.9.0 | Crucifixes will now have an extra 50% range (per Tier) against Demons. |} ==References== ru:Демон fr:Démon Category:Ghosts","title":"Demon","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Demon"}
{"content":"42 Edgefield Road (or simply Edgefield) is a small map in Phasmophobia. It is a two story, six-bedroom house with a basement, with a congested, claustrophobic environment. Despite the thin hallways, there are plenty of hiding spaces during a hunt, as a room to hide in is always a few paces away. Its tight hallways can often make it difficult to see past fellow investigators, and a team member may be encouraged to set up Video Cameras and observe key investigative details from the truck. ==Structure== Edgefield contains six bedrooms (including a nursery), six toilets, a dining room, a garage, and a basement, among other rooms. ===Layout tips=== *Both the basement hallway and the storage room separated by a door is considered a single \"Basement\" room. *For every bedroom on the second floor, the game considers both the room with the bed and the attached bathroom, if any, to be a single room. *In order to fully prevent passive sanity drain in the Hallway, the light switch controlling the outside lamp above the entrance door has to be switched on as well. *There is a bug where the computer in Small Blue Bedroom needs to be turned on to prevent passive sanity drain in that room. See Third-party tools for a list of detailed map viewers that players may use. ===Key hiding spots and strategies=== There are 9 \"sanctioned\" hiding spots in Edgefield: *Utility, back corner between shelves and washer (crouch against the washer) *Garage, lockers against far wall *Basement, lockers next to refrigerator *Small Blue Bedroom, closet at back *Upstairs Hallway, 2 closets across from green bedroom *Large Blue Bedroom, closet at back corner *Master Bedroom, 2 closets across from bed Depending on the difficulty, some of these hiding spots will be filled with bulky items, preventing players from hiding in them: *Amateur: None *Intermediate: 3 *Professional: 5 *Nightmare/Insanity: 7 *3-player game: +1 available hiding spot *4-player game: +2 available hiding spots <small>Additional hiding spots on multiplayer is overridden when \"Number of hiding places\" is set to None</small> Several more unofficial furniture-based hiding spots are available. While they are more risky, they will never be blocked unlike official hiding spots, and can still provide decent hiding in most cases. Examples include: *Hallway, behind a cupboard at the rear end of the hallway *Living Room, behind the bookshelf. It will block line-of-sight from the doorway, but it can be very risky if the ghost enters the living room. *Basement, behind the shelves in the storage room Looping the ghost is only possible around the living room couch, but the latter doesn't block line of sight. Using tier III Salt can be useful to slow down the ghost if one wants to test for certain ghosts (especially Poltergeist and Obake). ==Bone locations== Bones spawn randomly, but will only spawn in areas that a ghost can also walk on. ;Examples <div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\"><gallery widths=\"185\"> Bone edgefield utility.png|A large bone in a rug in Utility.

If the ghost is a Demon, this might even happen with a tier I Crucifix. *The assets used for this map can be found here. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access Alpha |- !19 March 2020 |Split the basement into two rooms mechanic-wise. |- !? |Converted the basement back into a single room. |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !0.7.0 |Renamed Edgefield Street House to 42 Edgefield Road. |}<br> Category:Maps Category:Small Map fr:42 Edgefield Road ru:42 Edgefield Road","title":"42 Edgefield Road","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/42_Edgefield_Road"}

{"content":"The Dayan is a type of ghost in Phasmophobia. Its unique trait allows it to speed up when players move near it but also makes it slow down when players stop moving. ==Behavior== ===Hunt=== When a player is within 10 metres of the Dayan, whether on the same floor or not, the ghost will have a modified hunt sanity threshold and hunt speed depending on further factors: *If the closest player is still, the threshold is decreased to 45% and the ghost will have a fixed speed of 1.2 m/s. *If the closest player is walking, the threshold is increased to 65% and the ghost will have a fixed speed of 2.25 m/s. If there is no player within 10 metres of the Dayan, it will have the standard threshold of 50% and follow standard ghost speeds with one particularity: if the Dayan has line-of-sight with a player within 10 metres, the speed increase from continuous line-of-sight adds in the background, and will only be applied once it is no longer near any player. ===Miscellaneous=== The Dayan can only be a female ghost and will use a female ghost model. ==Evidence== ==Strengths and weaknesses== These are the strengths and weaknesses as listed in the journal: Strength: The Dayan gains strength to protect herself if people 'dance' too close to her. Weakness: The Dayan loses strength if people close to her stand still. ==Strategies== At the beginning of a contract, the Dayan can already be excluded if the ghost presents a masculine name. The Dayan's ability to speed up when nearby players move arguably makes it one of the most dangerous ghosts in the game. Therefore, identifying the Dayan and completing the investigation without a hunt is preferable. During normal gameplay, players should assume the Dayan has a 65% hunting threshold, just hunting less often before 50% sanity, as it's impossible to completely avoid walking near the ghost. During a hunt, Incense and Tier III salt will play a highly important role to allow players time to hide or move out of the 10-metre ability range of the ghost. If neither of these options is available, it is worth crouching behind a looping spot out of immediate view of the ghost and remaining still until the hunt is over. If the Dayan spots you, line-of-sight breaks are a last resort for survival, as the ghost can quickly catch up to players. If line-of-sight cannot be broken, one can try to outrun the Dayan, as its maximum speed in range is slightly lower than the player's default maximum speed. The Dayan's ability makes standing still while one's sprint recharges look appealing, however walking should still be preferred. At normal speeds, the Dayan is slightly faster than the player; a Dayan will (under ideal circumstances) catch a player after 80 seconds, ignoring turning around corners. The player can avoid the ghost forever if the difficulty has lower ghost speeds or higher player speeds, but the player will have difficulty breaking out of the 10-metre range due to the line-of-sight increasing the speed outside of the range. Stopping while recharging sprint becomes the theoretical best strategy at higher ghost speeds and lower player speeds, however at these settings there is a high risk of the ghost catching the player before their sprint recharges. As such, the preferred movement should be to keep moving, even while at high difficulties. While normally used for restoring sanity, a Tier III Sanity Medication's speed boost can be used to escape the Dayan's ability range faster, assuming that the medication cannot be better used by restoring sanity before a hunt starts. ==Trivia== *A Dayan (or Daayan) is a malevolent ghostly presence derived in Indian and Pakistani Folklore. While the term in English typically describes a Dayan as a \"Witch\", it is more so described as a vengeful ghostly female spirit and not a living human. The folklore encourages the idea that they are a woman who would suffer from abuse and harsh cruelty and would return as a Daayan after her death. A Daayan would go on to haunt their family members and drink their blood, starting from the youngest male, draining his blood until he was an old man and then she would move on to other men of the family. It is also said that the Daayan would target younger families in order to \"make the young become older\". ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !0.15.1.0 |Added Dayan. |} fr:Dayan Category:Ghosts","title":"Dayan","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Dayan"}
{"content":"Freezing Temperatures (or Freezing Temps/Freezing) are a piece of evidence used to determine the type of ghost haunting the location. ==Mechanics== The presence of a ghost in a room will cause the room's temperature to decrease, regardless of evidence. Ghosts without Freezing Temperatures evidence will be able to drop the room's temperature to , whereas ghosts with Freezing Temperatures as evidence will be able to drop the temperature to . Freezing Temperatures can only be confirmed if the thermometer reads a temperature strictly below . *If using a Tier I thermometer, Freezing Temperatures should only be confirmed if the thermometer reads a temperature strictly below as it is less accurate between and (there are only 8 graduations between these two values instead of 9). ===Rewards=== Taking a photo of the thermometer while it is displaying a freezing temperature will yield a Freezing Temperatures photo, rewarding up to $7 and 7 XP, depending on the tier of the Photo Camera. ==Tips== ===Ghost location and temperatures=== Temperatures only decrease when the ghost is within a room, and although the ghost is more likely to stay in its ghost room, making it colder, freezing temperatures do not necessarily indicate the ghost room. Additionally, temperatures do not return to normal immediately after a ghost leaves a room. This means that multiple rooms can be freezing at once, and that players should not assume that low or freezing temperatures guarantees that the ghost is still in that room. Since 0.9.0, seeing cold breath is not an indicator of Freezing Temperatures. ===Weather=== If the fuse box is turned off at the start, Freezing Temperatures may be obtained quicker, depending on the weather and how often the ghost roams into other rooms. In particular, one could theoretically observe Freezing Temperatures in approximately two minutes if it is snowing, as long as the ghost stays in the same room for long enough. As of 0.9.0, temperatures drop at 1/3 the current speed, if the temperature is below the weather's ambient temperature. ===Visual effects=== Nearly all ghosts can initiate an \"airball\" ghost event which is visually similar to the player's breath, other than in movement. The airball does not count as an indicator for low temperatures. The main difference is that the airball event usually moves towards a particular player, while cold breath never moves by itself. ==Possible ghosts== {| class=\"article-table\" |Demon |Freezing Temperatures |Ultraviolet |Ghost Writing |- |Hantu |Freezing Temperatures |Ultraviolet |Ghost Orb |- |Jinn |Freezing Temperatures |EMF Level 5 |Ultraviolet |- |Moroi |Freezing Temperatures |Ghost Writing |Spirit Box |- |Oni |Freezing Temperatures |D.O.T.S.

{"content":"Unlocked at level 50, custom difficulty, as the name suggests, allows the player to modify various parameters relating to the player, the ghost, and the contract itself. In exchange, the reward multiplier is either increased (if the changes make the difficulty harder) or decreased (if the changes make the difficulty easier). The penalties for decreasing the difficulty are usually higher than the rewards for increasing it. ==Difficulty Modifiers== Each difficulty setting will show a coloured icon beside it, depending on how the reward multiplier is affected, mostly in relation to Amateur difficulty: * <span style=\"color: #00b800;\">Green:</span> Increased rewards * <span style=\"color: #b3a400;\">Yellow:</span> Limited by another difficulty setting * <span style=\"color: #b04500;\">Orange:</span> Decreased rewards * <span style=\"color: #a60002;\">Red:</span> Clamped or limited to a maximum reward multiplier In the following table, numbers in the Reward Modifier column are compared to the Base Reward. Every setting being set to Base Reward results in 1.00x rewards. Rewards cannot be lower than 0.00x or higher than 15.00x. *A modifier with + or - adds that number to the rewards multiplier. **e.g. +0.20x results in 3.00x -> 3.20x; -0.50x results in 3.20x -> 2.70x *A modifier with * multiplies the final rewards multiplier by that number. **e.g. *0.75x results in 4.00x -> 3.00x; *0.75x and *0.50x results in 1.00x -> 0.75x -> 0.37x *A clamp reduces the final rewards multiplier to that number, if it is higher. **e.g. a 2.00x clamp results in 3.00x -> 2.00x or 7.30x -> 2.00x; a 1.00x clamp would not affect 0.75x or 0.50x rewards Some parameters will affect other parameters. Such interactions are listed under the Secondary Modifier column. In the special case where modifiers are halved above 4.00x or 5.00x multipliers due to having 3 or 2 types of evidence respectively, the game first adds normally to reach the 4.00x or 5.00x multipliers, before adding half of what remains of the modifier. *For example, with 3 types of evidence and a multiplier at 3.80x, trying to add a modifier of +0.50x will first add 0.20x to reach 4.00x before adding half of the remaining 0.30x, which will give a final multiplier of 4.15x. {| class=\"fandom-table\" !Setting !Option !Reward Modifier !Secondary Modifier !Notes |- !

{"content":"The crucifix is a buyable item that is used to prevent ghosts from hunting. ==Mechanics== A crucifix can be held in the player's hand, , or ; the crucifix works in all three situations. Holding the placing button will show the default effective range for the crucifix; this is a translucent sphere with a radius depending on its tier level (even if the ghost has a different effective range): *Tier I: 3 metres *Tier II: 4 metres *Tier III: 5 metres When the ghost attempts to initiate a hunt within the crucifix's range, the hunt will fail to begin, and a charge will be used. The ghost is then teleported back to its favourite room. Each time a crucifix successfully prevents a hunt, an EMF Level 2 reading is created, with a 33% chance for this to be EMF Level 5 if it is one of the ghost's evidences. For the Demon, the crucifix's effective range is increased by 50% for each tier: *Tier I: 4.5 metres *Tier II: 6 metres *Tier III: 7.5 metres For the Gallu, the crucifix's effective range is decreased by 2 metres while in its \"enraged\" state, and increased by 1 metre while in its \"weakened\" state. The Tier I crucifix only has one charge, while tier II and tier III both have two charges. Each time it blocks a hunt attempt, a burning effect will appear, and the crucifix will glow visually before cooling down. On first use, one arm of the crucifix will disappear. On second use, more parts of the crucifix will disappear. If a player-held crucifix successfully prevents a hunt attempt, it will automatically be thrown on the ground. After the crucifix is completely burnt, the crucifix will be useless and have no further effect on the ghost. In addition, the crucifix will not work if: *The ghost is not within the specified range (even if the crucifix is located in the favourite room) *A cursed possession is used to initiate a cursed hunt (Except for in the case of an unused tier III crucifix, which can be used to stop a cursed hunt at the cost of both its charges) *A hunt has already started/is in progress Each time a crucifix is used, the ghost must wait a minimum of 25 seconds (20 seconds for a Demon) before attempting to initiate another hunt. The crucifix range is not limited by any obstacle such as walls and doors. This includes exterior walls, which means that it is possible for crucifixes to be used outside provided the ghost is within its range inside the investigation area. 42 Edgefield Road is a good example of this, where a ghost near the front of the house, even upstairs, could possibly use up a crucifix still hanging on the truck wall. ===Rewards=== Taking a photo of a crucifix that has been used once or twice will yield a Burned Crucifix photo, filming a crucifix while it is burning will yield a Burned Crucifix video, and recording the sound of a crucifix while it is burning will yield a Burned Crucifix sound. These pieces of media respectively reward up to $7 and 7 XP, $12 and 12 XP, and $7 and 7 XP, depending on the equipment tier and whether there is a Unique stamp. ==Tips== Although the crucifix works while held in-hand, it is strongly advised to place the crucifix on the ground, as this will free the player to do other objectives or hold onto more useful equipment during the investigation. ==Trivia== *Because it has no corpus (figure of the crucified Christ), the in-game item is not a true crucifix but rather just a regular cross. ==Gallery== <gallery orientation=\"Square\"> Crucifix used once 0.8.1.gif|A fresh tier II crucifix blocking its first hunt attempt.

{"content":"Ghosts are the main focus of Phasmophobia. Each ghost has a set of unique characteristics, including personal identifiers, abilities, and evidences. Players must investigate some of these aspects to correctly identify the ghost. The ghost can interact with its environment or perform ghost events, and even attempt to kill the player by initiating hunts. == Characteristics == Each ghost in a contract has a randomly generated unique identity consisting of the type of the ghost, gender, name, age, length of death, shyness (with respect to the Spirit Box), and a physical model that is determined at the start of the contract. Most of its general behaviour (such as movement speed, hunting patterns, activity, etc.) is based on the type of ghost, except for its willingness to respond to the spirit box in the presence of multiple people in the room, which is randomly set. ==Behavior== Each contract, one ghost will spawn within the map in a certain room. This room is very often the favourite room, and the ghost will wander back to it if not the case. After an exit door is opened for the first time, the ghost will be \"activated\" and be able to interact with the environment or the player. The ghost may stand still, roam or walk to another place, interact with objects and doors, use its abilities, and initiate ghost events or hunts. If a player attempts to enter the house without unlocking the exit door, the ghost will not be \"activated\" and cannot do interactions, ghost events, nor hunt, though some types of evidence (most notably Ghost Orbs) can be obtained. The ghost can however still be forced into initiating a cursed hunt using cursed possessions. Ghosts cannot exit the investigation area; they cannot walk out of the exit doors even if they are wide open. The following is a non-exhaustive list of \"states\" or \"phases\" that the ghost can enter (these terms are conjectural and may not be official): *Idling: The ghost stays still for 2-6 seconds *Roaming: The ghost chooses to perform either a short roam or a long roam, which are both defined by a smaller or larger spherical area, respectively. It then randomly picks a waypoint within that sphere, then checks the path distance to that waypoint. If successful, the ghost walks to that point, else it repeats the steps if the path distance is too long. Ghosts cannot initiate long roams outside their favourite rooms, except for Mare and Banshee. **When the ghost chooses to perform a roam, the chances for a short roam or a long roam are based on the \"Roaming frequency\" difficulty setting: ***Low: 90% for a short roam, 10% for a long roam ***Medium: 80% for a short roam, 20% for a long roam ***High: 70% for a short roam, 30% for a long roam **Short roams have a maximum of 3 metres, and long roams have a maximum of 12 metres *Favourite Room: The ghost returns to its favourite room *Interaction: The ghost interacts with an object nearby *Fuse Box: The ghost turns the fuse box on or off *Ghost Event: The ghost performs a ghost event *Ability: The ghost uses a specified ability, if any *Hunt: The ghost initiates a hunt *D.O.T.S: If the ghost has D.O.T.S Projector evidence, it will occasionally enter this state, and be visible via a D.O.T.S. Projector if it passes through its light It is important to note that certain phenomena often are generally not limited to one single type of ghost. For example, all ghosts can throw objects around in a room, manipulate doors, make Dirty Water appear in sinks, and present itself in any form. However, certain ghosts are more likely to exhibit certain behaviours than others or have unique abilities. For example, a Poltergeist will be more likely to throw objects and can throw several at once. ===Visibility=== In normal gameplay, ghosts are usually invisible and will only physically appear during (manifestation) ghost events and hunts. In a hunt, the ghost will flicker, repeatedly appearing and disappearing at a variable rate. For ghost events, the ghost can be fully visible, appear as a shadow, or have a dark translucent-like appearance. While the possible models a ghost can appear as depends on whether it is a female or male ghost, the ghost's specific model does not matter in determining what type of ghost it is, except for the Banshee and the Dayan, which are only female, and while this can be easily identified through the ghost's name before ever seeing the ghost, seeing its model serves as a good verification check in case of androgynous names. Ghosts with the D.O.T.S Projector evidence can be visible as a D.O.T.S silhouette through a video camera or to the naked eye (except for the Goryo) while passing through a D.O.T.S. Projector's light during a D.O.T.S state. ===Interference=== When a ghost manifests or hunts, all electronic equipment (brought in from the truck), such as flashlights and global chat, will malfunction within a 10-meter radius for most ghosts (15 for the Raiju). Room lights may also flicker at the same distance. ===Sounds=== When a ghost event or hunt occurs, the ghost will produce a vocalization that may differ between ghost events (but not hunts). If it is walking during such events (or walks after stepping in salt), it will also produce footstep sounds. For most ghosts, these sounds can be heard from up to 20 meters away by the player. There are seven male and six female sounds produced by the ghosts during manifestations: {| class=article-table !Male !Female |- | | |} <br>Every contract, the ghost gets a random but specific hunting sound. In every following hunt it will use the very same sound again. Remembering this sound from a former hunt can help the player tell a hunt apart from a ghost event. Ghosts will also produce a \"paranormal sound\" (groaning/laughing/talking/whisper) every 80 - 127 seconds (every 64 - 127 seconds for the Myling) that can only be heard through a Parabolic Microphone or a Sound Recorder. These paranormal sounds are different from ghost event/hunt vocalizations. If a player is within 10 meters of the ghost and would be considered \"visible\" to the ghost when not considering furniture, the player will hear their own heartbeat. Note that this does not necessarily correlate with actual line-of-sight. ==Types of ghosts<span class=\"anchor\" id=\"Ghost types\"></span>== There are currently 27 types of ghosts in the game, appearing in the journal in the following order: {| class=\"article-table\" style=\"text-align: center\" style=\"margin: auto;\" | Banshee || Dayan || Deogen |- | Demon || Gallu || Goryo |- | Hantu || Jinn || Mare |- | Moroi || Myling || Obake |- | Obambo || Oni || Onryo |- | Phantom || Poltergeist || Raiju |- | Revenant || Shade || Spirit |- | Thaye || The Mimic || The Twins |- | Wraith || Yokai || Yurei |} <br>All ghosts have an equal chance of being chosen per contract in all difficulties, except the Deogen, that will not be chosen if the host is below Prestige 0, Level 30. Otherwise, it is normal and expected for the number of ghosts encountered by type to vary, the sums of which will roughly be shaped like a bell curve graph with an increasing number of rounds played. Historically, newly added ghosts had an increased chance of being chosen during the first few weeks of their introduction. Depending on its type, the ghost will have unique strengths and weaknesses. The following table summarizes these: {| class=\"fandom-table\" !Ghost type !Strengths !Weaknesses |- !Banshee |Will target a chosen player, assuming said player is inside.<br>Increased chance of performing a singing ghost event. |Has several distinctive wails on the Parabolic Microphone and the Sound Recorder. |- !Dayan |Moves faster when a player moves near the Dayan. |Moves slower when a player stands still near the Dayan. |- !Demon |Incense is less effective, preventing a hunt for less time.<br>Can rarely initiate a hunt at any sanity level. |Crucifix range is 50% larger than placement range indicator. |- !Deogen |Always knows where the player is during a hunt and moves very quickly toward its victim. |Moves extremely slowly once near its victim. |- !Gallu |Becomes aggressive when protective equipment is used. |Becomes less aggressive after a hunt. |- !Goryo |Can only enter a D.O.T.S. state when no player is in the same room.<br>Its D.O.T.S. silhouette can only be seen through a Video Camera. |Cannot wander far from its room, or change favorite rooms. |- !Hantu |Lower temperatures allow the Hantu to move faster during hunts. |Warmer areas slow the Hantu's movement while hunting.<br>Will produce freezing breath during a hunt if the fuse box is off.<br>Will never turn the fuse box on. |- !Jinn |Travels at a faster speed if a distant player is in line of sight while the fuse box is on.<br>Can occasionally drain large amounts of sanity from a nearby player. |Cannot use its ability if the fuse box is off.<br>Will never turn the fuse box off directly. |- !Mare |Can hunt at a higher sanity in the dark. |Has a lower hunt sanity threshold in the light.<br>Will occasionally turn lights off immediately after a player has turned them on.<br>Will never turn a light on. |- !Moroi |Moves noticeably faster at low average sanity.<br>Can curse players, making them lose sanity quicker than usual while in the investigation zone. |Incense blinds the ghost for 50% longer during hunts. |- !Myling |Only becomes audible during a hunt at a closer range than other ghosts. |Produces paranormal sounds more frequently on the Parabolic Microphone. |- !Obake |Has a chance to not leave fingerprints when interacting with things.<br>May cause existing fingerprints to disappear sooner than usual. |Has a small chance of leaving special fingerprints.<br>Can briefly shapeshift into another model during a hunt. |- !Obambo |Hunts earlier and moves faster in its \"aggressive\" state. |Hunts later and moves slower in its \"calm\" state.<br>Hunts initiated in its \"aggressive\" state have a reduced duration. |- !Oni |Increased activity when players are nearby. |More visible during hunts.<br>Cannot perform the \"airball\" ghost event. |- !Onryo |Will attempt to hunt after it has extinguished three flames regardless of average sanity. |A nearby lit flame will prevent the Onryo from hunting, just like a crucifix. |- !Phantom |Looking at a Phantom and hearing heartbeat sounds will drain the player's sanity.<br>Will occasionally walk to a random player. |Taking a photo of the Phantom will cause it to disappear.<br>Less visible during hunts. |- !Poltergeist |Capable of throwing multiple objects at once.<br>Can throw objects at high velocities. |Becomes powerless with no throwables nearby. |- !Raiju |Moves faster near active electronic equipment. |Disrupts electronic equipment from further away when it hunts. |- !Revenant |Moves significantly faster when a player is detected during a hunt. |Moves very slowly when not detecting a player. |- !Shade |Less likely to perform interactions. |Cannot hunt if people are nearby. |- !Spirit |No strength. |Incense is more effective, preventing a hunt for longer. |- !Thaye |Moves faster during a hunt and much more active in general at the beginning of a contract. |Becomes slower and less active over time when players are nearby. |- !The Mimic |Can mimic the abilities and traits of other ghosts. |Will present fake Ghost Orbs as secondary evidence. |- !The Twins |Either twin may start a hunt, though not at the same time.<br>One twin is slow, the other is fast. |Will often interact with the environment at the same time but usually in different places. |- !Wraith |Cannot be tracked by footsteps.<br>Will occasionally teleport to a random player. |Will not step in salt. |- !Yokai |Talking in the same room as a Yokai temporarily allows it to hunt at a much higher sanity threshold than usual. |Can only hear players within a short radius during a hunt. |- !Yurei |Can quickly drain sanity from nearby players. |Smudging the Yurei will temporarily trap it and reduce how often it wanders.<br>Using its ability causes it to slam doors. |} ==Evidence== Please see Evidence or a ghost's page for detailed information about identifying different ghost types. {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Ghost !EMF&nbsp;5 !Orb !Spirit&nbsp;Box !Freezing !Ultraviolet !Writing

|} ==Random characteristics== These characteristics are randomized for every contract and are unrelated to the ghost type. ===Gender=== There is a 50/50 chance of the ghost being either male or female, except for the Banshee and the Dayan which will always be female. ===Length of death=== The length of death of a ghost (i.e. the age it would be today if it were still alive) is a randomly generated number between 50 (overlapping with their death age between 50 and 90) and 1000 years. ===Age=== The age of the ghost (at their time of death) is a randomly generated number between 10 and 90 years. Note that this is not correlated with the ghost model. ===Spirit box responsiveness=== If the ghost is indicated to respond only to \"people who are alone\", the ghost will only respond to the Spirit Box if there is only one player in the room when the question is asked. A ghost which responds to everyone means that the number of people in the room does not affect its ability to respond. This characteristic is not indicated if there is no setup time (e.g., on Professional and Nightmare difficulties). This characteristic is only relevant for ghosts with the Spirit Box evidence, and is not synonymous with ghost activity. ===Ghost's name=== The name of the ghost consists of their first (given) name and a surname. The first name is determined randomly according to their gender, while the surname is randomly chosen and not based on their gender. Saying the ghost's name near it has a chance of raising its activity level and cause it to interact with its surroundings. ====Possible male names==== <div style=\"-moz-column-count:3; -webkit-column-count:3; column-count:3;\"> *Alex *Amit *Andrew *Anthony *Benjamin *Billy *Bradley *Brenden *Brian *Carlos *Charles *Christopher *Corey *Daniel *Dave *David *Donald *Edward *Eric *Gary *George *Grant *Gregory *Harold *Hugo *Jack *James *Jan *Jason *Jay *Jerry *John *Joseph *Justin *Keith *Kenneth *Kenny *Kevin *Kyle *Larry *Leslie *Luke *Mark *Michael *Paul *Peter *Raymond *Richard *Robert *Robin *Ronald *Russell *Steven *Thomas *Ted *Tim *Walter *William </div> ====Possible female names==== <div style=\"-moz-column-count:3; -webkit-column-count:3; column-count:3;\"> *Ann *April *Barbara *Becky *Betty *Borris *Carla *Carol *Catherine *Catiana *Cora *Donna *Doris *Dorothy *Edie *Elizabeth *Ella *Ellen *Emily *Emma *Eva *Georgia *Gloria *Heather *Helen *Holly *Jane *Jazz *Jennifer *Jennise *Jessica *Jo *Josefine *Judy *Julie *Karen *Kate *Kelly *Kim *Leslie *Linda *Lisa *Livy *Lori *Lucy *Marcia *Margaret *Maria *Marie *Mary *Megan *Michelle *Nancy *Nellie *Patricia *Robin *Rose *Ruth *Sandra *Sarah *Shannon *Sharne *Shelly *Sophie *Stacey *Susan *Tricia </div> ====Possible surnames==== <div style=\"-moz-column-count:3; -webkit-column-count:3; column-count:3;\"> *Alexander *Anderson *Bailey *Baker *Barber *Barton *Bellfield *Birch *Bishop *Bowen *Brock *Brooks *Brown *Buckley *Carey *Carter *Clark *Clarke *Cordero *Corrigan *Davis *Dexter *Dixon *Doe *Douglas *Dyer *Elliott *Emmett *Everly *Gacy *Garcia *Gayton *Halstead *Hans *Harris *Hill *Holland *Holmes *Huntley *Jackson *Johnson *Jones *Kemper *Knight *Kraft *Kray *Lancaster *Lavender *Lee *Lewis *Manson *Marsh *Martin *Martinez *Maudsley *Miller *Mills *Moore *Myers *Nilsen *Norris *Pettit *Phillips *Ramirez *Rhoades *Roberts *Robinson *Rook *Roswell *Schelin *Shawcross *Sherman *Shipman *Skinner *Smith *Stevens *Straffen *Sweeney *Taylor *Thomas *Thompson *Todd *Walker *Watts *West *White *Williams *Wilson *Winter *Wright *Young </div> ==Trivia== *The initial list of names in the game were included based on American name popularity in the past 100 years, making the same name frequency more realistic.

{"content":"EMF Level 5 (or EMF 5) is a piece of evidence used to determine the type of ghost haunting the location. ==Mechanics== When a ghost with EMF Level 5 as one of its evidences interacts with the environment, each EMF reading will have a 33% chance to be an EMF 5 emission instead of EMF 2 or EMF 3, which can be detected and confirmed with an EMF Reader. This applies to any action that will normally create EMF 2 or EMF 3, such as interactions, (some) abilities and so on. It does not apply to EMF 4. ===Rewards=== Recording the sound of an EMF Level 5 will yield an EMF 5 Reading sound in the journal, rewarding up to $12 and 12 XP, depending on the tier of the Sound Recorder and whether there is a Unique stamp. ==Possible ghosts== {| class=\"article-table\" |Dayan |EMF Level 5 |Ghost Orb |Spirit Box |- |Gallu |EMF Level 5 |Ultraviolet |Spirit Box |- |Goryo |EMF Level 5 |D.O.T.S.

Projector |Spirit Box |} ==Tips== ===Increasing interactions=== EMF 5 is a random chance, so one would want to increase the chance of the ghost interacting with the environment. One can place some props in the ghost room for the ghost to throw. Make sure to turn off the room lights, as ghosts cannot throw items if the lights in its current room are on. Smudging the ghost or saying recognised phrases near the ghost can mildly increase the chance/rate of interactions. ===EMF from the Site Activity Monitor=== It is possible to \"guess\" EMF Level 5 as an evidence using the site activity monitor, though this is not guaranteed. This is because the site activity monitor is an approximate representation of the total EMF currently present in the map, with a modifier of 0, -1 or -2 for each EMF generated. Hence, EMF level 5 can be \"guessed\" if multiple straight-line jumps of 4 and 5 levels are observed, especially if no players are currently inside the investigation area. Though an EMF 5 emission can be represented by an activity change of 3 levels, an EMF 3 is just as likely to do the same, so a jump of 3 levels is generally ignored. Some occurrences may also show up as jumps of 4 or 5 levels; avoid erroneously taking these to represent EMF 5: *A ghost event, which generates EMF 4. Hunts also always generate EMF 4 but this is rarely observed *The Poltergeist's multi-throw ability *Using cursed possessions to force interactions or ghost events, resulting in two EMF 2/3 interactions happening within the same second, or EMF 4 from ghost events and hunts *A hunt ending, sometimes causing a jump from level 10 to level 5/6 *In general, interactions occurring very close to each-other Either way, using an EMF Reader is a far more reliable way of verifying EMF 5 as a piece of evidence. ==See also== *Objectives Category:Evidence fr:EMF niveau 5 ru:Детектор ЭМП (ур. 5)","title":"EMF Level 5","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/EMF_Level_5"}
{"content":"The Gallu is a type of ghost in Phasmophobia. It is known to become faster during hunts when players use protective equipment against it such as crucifixes or incense. ==Behavior== ===Activity=== The Gallu cannot disturb salt piles while in its enraged state. ===Ability=== The Gallu has three states it can switch to: \"normal\", \"enraged\", and \"weakened\". By default, it starts in the normal state, where it behaves like a standard ghost. It will change from the normal state to the enraged state or from the weakened state to the normal state: *instantly after burning a crucifix *instantly after the end of the incense's blinding effect during a hunt *after a duration equal to the last blinding effect from an incense after being affected by incense outside of a hunt **instantly if no incense were used during any previous hunts **4 seconds if the Gallu was last blinded while in an enraged state **5 seconds if the Gallu was last blinded while in a normal state **6 seconds if the Gallu was last blinded while in a weakened state *2 seconds after stepping in salt if its current state is \"normal\" *3 seconds after stepping in salt if its current state is \"weakened\" The state changes cannot be queued. For example, a weakened Gallu stepping in a second salt pile 1 second after stepping into the first one will not make it change into the enraged state 1 second after changing into the normal state. ===Hunt=== If a hunt ends while the Gallu is in its enraged state, it will instantly switch to the weakened state. The following table lists the Gallu's behavior depending on its current state: {| class=\"article-table\" |+ !Behavior !Normal state !Enraged state !Weakened state |- !Hunt sanity threshold |50% |60% |40% |- !Crucifix range |Standard | -2 meters | +1 meter |- !Hunt base speed |1.7 m/s |1.955 m/s |1.36 m/s |- !Incense's blinding effect |5 seconds |4 seconds |6 seconds |} ==Evidence== ==Strengths and weaknesses== These are the strengths and weaknesses as listed in the journal: Strength: Using protective equipment pushes the ghost to become enraged, weakening equipment effects. Weakness: Being enraged exhausts the Gallu, making protective equipment more effective. ==Strategies== One should exercise extreme caution with the Gallu, especially when collecting any evidence. As the Gallu has Ultraviolet evidence, the player may be prompted to confirm Ultraviolet or collect extra media using salt, which if stepped in, will cause the Gallu to enter its enraged state. Note that the tier of salt does not matter; the tier 1 salt is able to cause the ghost to enter its enraged state, even if it realistically has no effect on the ghosts' hunting ability entirely. However, this behaviour can also be used as an advantage in identifying the Gallu. As it is unable to step on salt piles once it is in an enraged state, this can help narrow down a Gallu greatly by taking note if the ghost only stepped on one pile of salt and no more, even if it had walked through the latter. Be careful to not confuse this with a Wraith, which can also not step on any salt and also shares two evidence types with the Gallu, that being Spirit Box and EMF Level 5. If you used an Incense near the ghost, or had a Crucifix be used recently before any salt was tested, then a Gallu should be considered if the salt has not been stepped in at all. ==Trivia== *In Mesopotamian and Sumerian mythology, a gallu (or galla) is a demon or devil from the underworld. It was known for dragging people into the underworld until it was appeased by animal sacrifice, most noted in the story of Inanna's journey to the underworld. *With line-of-sight (LOS) acceleration, the Gallu can achieve a top speed of 3.23 m/s in its enraged state, making it the joint second fastest ghost in the game behind the Moroi (3.71 m/s) and tied with the Obambo. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !0.15.1.0 |Added Gallu. |} ==Notes== fr:Gallu Category:Ghosts","title":"Gallu","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Gallu"}
{"content":"In Phasmophobia, death results either from being caught by the ghost during a hunt, obtaining The Hanged Man tarot card, or by chance from using the Monkey Paw's revival wish. ==Mechanics== ===Player's death=== When a player dies, all their equipment is dropped onto the ground and grotesque hands appear on their screen suggesting the player is being choked, for about 5 seconds. The player is then teleported to an otherworldly room with the ghost itself standing under a light, both standing around hanged corpses for about 5 more seconds. The light then shatters, the room goes dark, and the hanged corpses twitch slightly. Finally, the dead player teleports back to the location where they died, in form of an observer (see below). The whole process takes about 10 seconds. From another player's perspective, the victim drops their equipment, brings their hands to their neck while writhing from being strangled by an invisible force with a choking sound, and drops dead. ===Observer=== An observer will see the map through a greyish fog and can only communicate with other observers, though they can still hear the living (which may sound incorrectly muffled due to a bug), including the global chat radio. Observers will be able to phase through all forms of doors, even if they are locked. Ghosts will ignore dead players. Motion Sensors will be triggered if an observer walks past them. Observers can sprint infinitely, unlike regular players which run out of breath after a few seconds and have to \"recharge\" (unless the \"Sprint duration\" difficulty setting is set to infinite). Observers cannot pick up or interact with equipment or any other investigation-sensitive items (such as bones or cursed possessions). However, they can still pick up decorative items found around the map (dishes, notebooks, shoes, etc). ===Reviving a dead player=== If a living player draws a Tarot Card labeled The High Priestess, one dead player will randomly be chosen to be revived. The dead player will reappear at the location of their Dead Body (even if they were outside the investigation before being resurrected). Otherwise, the observer will remain as one until the game ends. The Monkey Paw can also be used to revive an existing dead player, but with a 50% chance of killing the wisher at the same time. If a player dies and revives in the same hunt, they cannot be killed again for that hunt (i.e. the player cannot die twice in the same hunt). ===End of the round=== If all players in the round die, the game will end shortly after the last player returns as an observer. ==Post-mortem== While dead, players may still help the investigation in the following manner: *Players can attempt to use random items to interact with the other living players. They can turn their attention to themselves if they find the Bone Evidence or if they know any useful information e.g. approximately where the ghost will spawn for its next hunt, or what type of ghost it is. **Items held by dead players vary in visibility depending on their current platform. When playing on desktop, items are invisible when held and only reveal themselves when thrown or placed down. If, however, the dead player is in VR, the held item is always visible to their teammates, and manifests as floating in midair. Clever players can use this to more accurately convey ideas, and, in some cases \"write\" out simple words in air gestures. ===Pranking & griefing=== Naturally, there is nothing preventing malicious players from also acting in bad faith; they can make deliberate attempts to prank, confuse, or otherwise lightly sabotage investigation post-mortem with their limited abilities. Since throwing items as an observer does not trigger a sound to the living survivors, imitating the ghost throwing items is not possible. However, throwing a ball down the stairs may confuse the remaining players about the ghost's location. As observers are capable of tripping motion sensors, they can potentially confuse living players about the ghost's real location. They may also move and place miscellaneous items such as dolls and teddy bears in key locations like doorways so as to appear to be stalking the remaining investigators. However, as the ghost is incapable of such specific behaviour, experienced players can quickly discern what is a ghost interaction/event and what is the work of another player. ==Post-game rewards== If the player is still dead when the round ends (and not revived by Tarot Cards), the difficulty multiplier will not be applied, and their rewards will be halved instead. They will also lose any equipment that they added to the game, instead receiving a percentage of the total value of the items that they added, depending on the difficulty multiplier. {| class=\"article-table\" |+Insurance !Difficulty!!Percentage of Value |- |Amateur<br>Difficulty with multiplier ≤ 1x |50% |- |Intermediate<br>Difficulty with multiplier ≤ 2x |25% |- |Professional<br>Nightmare<br>Insanity<br>Difficulty with multiplier > 2x |0% |} ==See also== *Dead Body ==References== Category:Gameplay fr:Décès","title":"Death","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Death"}

{"content":"D.O.T.S Projector is a type of evidence in Phasmophobia, used to determine which ghost is haunting a location. It is detected by placing a D.O.T.S. Projector in close proximity of a ghost, and allowing it to pass through it. ==Mechanics== Ghosts with D.O.T.S evidence will occasionally enter a \"D.O.T.S state\". During this, a faint silhouette of the ghost will be visible only when it passes through the laser grid. The ghost will also walk towards the nearest player if there is one in the same room, or towards a random waypoint if no players are nearby. While these silhouettes are visible to the naked eye (unless the ghost is a Goryo), a video camera with night vision may allow for better visibility. This also means that D.O.T.S can be tracked simultaneously alongside Ghost Orbs. Dead players cannot see the D.O.T.S state by any means. ===Ghost-specific abilities=== ====Banshee==== The Banshee will try to walk towards its targeted player, even if another player is closer to it. ====Goryo==== If the ghost is a Goryo, the silhouette will not be visible to the naked eye and can only be seen when the following two conditions are fulfilled: *There are no players in the same room as the Goryo when it enters a D.O.T.S state *The D.O.T.S silhouette must be viewed with a video camera One way to look for this behaviour is to view the projector from outside the room; if it is visible on the camera but not to the naked eye, the ghost is likely a Goryo. ====Phantom==== The Phantom will physically disappear if a photo or a video of it is taken while in a D.O.T.S state. ===Rewards=== The D.O.T.S silhouette can be photographed or video recorded, and will show up as D.O.T.S. Ghost in the journal. Both the photo and the video can reward up to $12 and 12 XP depending on the equipment tier and whether there is a Unique stamp. The photo will complete the \"Capture a photo of the Ghost\" objective and the video will complete the \"Capture a video of a Ghost\" objective. Because of the nature of the D.O.T.S silhouette and the ghost's tendency to move toward the nearest player, the D.O.T.S Ghost video recording is exceedingly hard to get. ==Potential ghosts== {| class=\"article-table\" |Banshee |D.O.T.S Projector |Ultraviolet |Ghost Orb |- |Deogen |D.O.T.S Projector |Ghost Writing |Spirit Box |- |Goryo |D.O.T.S Projector |EMF Level 5 |Ultraviolet |- |Obambo |D.O.T.S Projector |Ghost Writing |Ultraviolet |- |Oni |D.O.T.S Projector |EMF Level 5 |Freezing Temperatures |- |Phantom |D.O.T.S Projector |Spirit Box |Ultraviolet |- |Raiju |D.O.T.S Projector |Ghost Orb |EMF Level 5 |- |Thaye |D.O.T.S Projector |Ghost Orb |Ghost Writing |- |Wraith |D.O.T.S Projector |EMF Level 5 |Spirit Box |- |Yokai |D.O.T.S Projector |Spirit Box |Ghost Orb |- |Yurei |D.O.T.S Projector |Ghost Orb |Freezing Temperatures |} ==Tips== *When two D.O.T.S fields overlap, the illuminated ghost may fail to be captured on camera and result in 'blank' photos. When this happens, turn one D.O.T.S. projector off or space them further apart. Category:Evidence ru:Лазерный проектор (Улика)","title":"D.O.T.S.

{"content":"Cursed possessions are a group of seven powerful, supernatural items that are used to directly interface with the ghost. They can make the ghost appear or provide information, generally at the cost of sanity. These items are the Music Box, Ouija Board, Voodoo Doll, Haunted Mirror, Summoning Circle, Monkey Paw, and Tarot Cards. Activating or using a cursed possession will immediately cancel the setup phase. ==Mechanics== On all default difficulties, except Insanity, one cursed possession is selected at random for every contract. Each item has one dedicated spawn location on a given map. On most maps these spawn locations are scattered around the map, while on a few (namely Brownstone High School, Prison, and Sunny Meadows), they are all within just one room. The use of cursed possessions is not mandatory. All objectives can be completed without them, and only a handful of Daily and Weekly Tasks require them outright. Cursed possessions grant players a level of control over the investigative process and the overall flow of a mission, but come with the risk of causing a hunt. *The Music Box causes the ghost to sing, broadcasting its current location. *The Haunted Mirror provides a view into the Ghost Room. *The Ouija Board permits players to ask the ghost various questions. *The Summoning Circle teleports the ghost to the circle. *The Tarot Cards provokes various ghost activities. *The Voodoo Doll forces the ghost to perform interactions. *The Monkey Paw grants the player various wishes to call upon. Cursed possessions generally only work while the player is in the investigation area. All, except for the Summoning Circle and Ouija Board, must be picked up in order to be activated. Cursed possessions require a free hand to pick up, and cannot be stored in the inventory. Instead they drop to the ground when switching to a different item, like the Tripod. The Summoning Circle is the only item that is immovable, and must be interacted with by using either an igniter or a lit firelight. A photo can be taken of each spawned cursed possession in a contract. Photos reward up to $7 and 7 XP depending on the tier of the Photo Camera and whether there is a Unique stamp. ===Enabling the \"Friendly ghost\" option=== On Custom difficulty setting, when the \"Friendly ghost\" option is enabled, no hunt will occur after any of the following situations that would normally cause them: *When the \"Death\" tarot card is drawn *When the haunted mirror, music box, and Ouija board breaks *When the heart pin of the voodoo doll is pushed in or when all pins are pushed in at once at 0% sanity *When the summoning circle-triggered ghost event ends *When the \"I wish to see the ghost\" and \"I wish to trap the ghost\" effects end, and when \"I wish for knowledge\" is asked of the Monkey Paw Additionally, \"The Hanged Man\" tarot card cannot be drawn, except for \"The Fool\" version. All other effects of these cursed possessions work as normal with the setting enabled. ==Related difficulty settings== *Cursed Possessions quantity: The number of Cursed Possessions available *Cursed Possession #1 - #7: Enables the player to select the cursed possession(s), if desired ==Objectives and tasks== *Weekly task: Use cursed possessions ==Gallery== <gallery> Tanglewood-Music2.png|The Music Box in 6 Tanglewood Drive.

{"content":"The flashlight is an essential piece of equipment that is used to illuminate the area, usually in front of the player. ==Usage== on an equipped flashlight will provide a small conical range of light to improve visibility of the environment. The flashlight can also be put on the shoulder by to another item, allowing its use offhand. When on the shoulder, the flashlight can be turned on or off by pressing the key. Non-VR players can carry only one flashlight at a time, while VR players can have any number of flashlights held or placed onto the toolbelt. Illuminated flashlights will continue providing light from the hips until a player manually turns it off. While on the toolbelt, emitted light will track the player's head movement. Up to 4 flashlights can be brought on a single contract. One flashlight is always provided per contract as a starter equipment. During a hunt, a flashlight will rapidly flicker if a ghost is within 10 metres (15 metres if it is a Raiju) and on the same floor. Like other electronic equipment, carrying a lit flashlight within 7.5 metres of the ghost during a hunt on the same floor will attract it. ==Tips== *Extra flashlights can be dropped within dark areas of the map to provide illumination that remains unaffected by the state of the fuse box (though is subject to electronic interference during a hunt). This may be helpful if a ghost tampers with the lights and/or fuse box frequently. ==Gallery== <gallery> File:Phasmophobia flashlight old vs new.png|thumb|Pre-0.3.0 flashlight vs its subsequent updated model File:Flashlight tier comparison.png|thumb|Comparison of the 3 tiers of flashlights on 6 Tanglewood Drive </gallery> ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !rowspan=\"2\" |0.3.0 |Changed the flashlight model. |- |Changed the light color to yellowish. |- !0.9.0 |The Flashlight now has 3 tiers. |- !0.9.3.0 |Flashlight III Upgrade now costs $3000 (up from $2500). |} Category:Equipment Category:Starter Equipment fr:Lampe de poche ru:Фонарик","title":"Flashlight","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Flashlight"}
{"content":"Evidence is used to determine which ghost is haunting the location. Each ghost has a unique combination of three pieces of evidence that determines which ghost is present. Each player can record pieces of evidence that has been uncovered in the Journal to thin down the possible ghosts, and determine the ghost once all three piece of evidence are collected. ==Types of evidence== There are currently seven unique pieces of evidence in the game that can be used to identify a ghost: {| class=\"article-table\" | EMF Level 5 :Get a level 5 reading on the EMF Reader |- | D.O.T.S Projector :Witness a ghostly disturbance within D.O.T.S Projector lights |- | Ultraviolet :Uncover finger, hand, or footprints with the UV Light |- | Freezing Temperatures :Get a reading below 0°C/32°F on a Thermometer |- | Ghost Orb :See floating orbs on video (through Video Camera, Video Feed, or Head Gear) |- | Ghost Writing :Have a ghost write in a Ghost Writing Book that's been placed down |- | Spirit Box :Hear a reply on a Spirit Box after asking the ghost a question |} ==Ghost evidence== By default, each ghost can give 3 types of evidence. On Nightmare difficulty, each ghost can only provide 2 types of evidence, meaning at the start of the contract, the game will randomly choose 2 types, and the remaining type will be hidden (unobtainable). Similarly, Insanity difficulty causes each ghost to only give 1 type of evidence, with the other 2 being hidden. The 'Evidences given' option for a custom difficulty can also be changed for the ghost to give 0, 1, 2, or 3 types of evidence. {| class=\"article-table sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" !Ghost !Evidence 1 !Evidence 2 !Evidence 3 |- |Banshee |D.O.T.S Projector||Ghost Orb||Ultraviolet |- |Dayan |EMF Level 5||Ghost Orb||Spirit Box |- |Demon |Ghost Writing||Ultraviolet||Freezing Temperatures |- |Deogen |D.O.T.S Projector||Ghost Writing||<u>Spirit Box</u> |- |Gallu |EMF Level 5||Ultraviolet||Spirit Box |- |Goryo |<u>D.O.T.S Projector</u>||EMF Level 5||Ultraviolet |- |Hantu |Ghost Orb||Ultraviolet||<u>Freezing Temperatures</u> |- |Jinn |EMF Level 5||Ultraviolet||Freezing Temperatures |- |Mare |Ghost Writing||Ghost Orb||Spirit Box |- |Moroi |Ghost Writing||Freezing Temperatures||<u>Spirit Box</u> |- |Myling |Ghost Writing||EMF Level 5||Ultraviolet |- |Obake |EMF Level 5||Ghost Orb||<u>Ultraviolet</u> |- |Obambo |Ghost Writing||Ultraviolet||D.O.T.S Projector |- |Oni |D.O.T.S Projector||EMF Level 5||Freezing Temperatures |- |Onryo |Ghost Orb||Freezing Temperatures||Spirit Box |- |Phantom |D.O.T.S Projector||Ultraviolet||Spirit Box |- |Poltergeist |Ghost Writing||Ultraviolet||Spirit Box |- |Raiju |D.O.T.S Projector||EMF Level 5||Ghost Orb |- |Revenant |Ghost Writing||Ghost Orb||Freezing Temperatures |- |Shade |Ghost Writing||EMF Level 5||Freezing Temperatures |- |Spirit |Ghost Writing||EMF Level 5||Spirit Box |- |Thaye |D.O.T.S Projector||Ghost Writing||Ghost Orb |- |The Mimic |Ultraviolet||Freezing Temperatures||Spirit Box |- |The Twins |EMF Level 5||Freezing Temperatures||Spirit Box |- |Wraith |D.O.T.S Projector||EMF Level 5||Spirit Box |- |Yokai |D.O.T.S Projector||Ghost Orb||Spirit Box |- |Yurei |D.O.T.S Projector||Ghost Orb||Freezing Temperatures |} Some pieces of evidence are guaranteed for specific ghosts, shown as <u>bold and underlined</u> on the table, meaning that on Nightmare or Insanity difficulty (or if the 'Evidences given' option is set to 1 or 2), they will not be hidden and will always be one of the ghost's given evidences. This does not apply if the 'Evidences given' option is set to 0. The Mimic will always produce Ghost Orbs in addition to its chosen evidences. This works differently from the above \"forced\" evidences, as none of the Mimic's usual evidences (Spirit Box, Ultraviolet, and Freezing Temperatures) are guaranteed to appear when 'Evidences given' is 1 or 2, while the extra Ghost Orbs are always present even when 'Evidences given' is 0. ==Trivia== *It is not required to update all of the evidence options if the ghost has already been conclusively determined; simply selecting the correct type of ghost is sufficient. *During the development of Phasmophobia, the presence of bugs was planned to be an evidence. This is why they appear in the early VR gameplay trailer for the game. ==See also== *Third-party tools Category:Evidence Category:Gameplay fr:Preuve ru:Улики","title":"Evidence","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Evidence"}
{"content":".]] An exit door is a physical barrier, often in the form of a door, that separates the safe area (usually the \"outside\") from the investigation area of any given map. == Mechanics == Each map will have at least one exit door, with the truck located in a way that allows the player to walk directly to it. Some maps contain more than one exit door, which may or may not be directly accessible from the truck. In Maple Lodge Campsite and Camp Woodwind, the exit door is a set of wooden gates as opposed to a building door. The main door key must first be obtained to unlock the door. When any exit door is opened for the first time, the setup phase will begin and the ghost will \"activate\". As soon as a player steps inside the investigation area, their sanity can become affected. When a ghost begins to hunt, all exit doors will automatically close and become locked, indicated with a distinctive locking sound followed by a door \"slam\" sound, preventing players from leaving the investigation area. On top of the locked door, an invisible barrier will also form at all exit doors. This barrier forms the instant the ghost initiates a hunt, which is sooner than the door's closing animation. They will remain locked until the hunt ends, after which they will automatically become unlockable, but remain closed. Already locked exit doors do not make sound upon the beginning of a hunt. The ghost may close (but not lock) exit doors during ghost events if the player who \"activated\" the event is in a room that connects to an exit door. The Yurei can also close the door without a ghost event or hunt by using its ability. Otherwise, ghosts cannot interact with exit doors normally. ==Trivia== * Items, as well as equipment, can be thrown through doors at any time, even while closed or locked. * If the player glitches into the investigation area without unlocking the exit door for the first time, the ghost will remain inactive, and will not hunt, perform ghost events, or provide most evidences (apart from Ghost Orbs). *Exit doors can show a handprint. For this to happen, the ghost must be The Mimic, it must be mimicking a Yurei, and it must use the door-closing ability on the exit door. Hence, this occurrence is extremely rare. == Gallery == <gallery> Grafton Exit Door.png|The exit door on Grafton Farmhouse.

{"content":"Difficulties in Phasmophobia adjust the player experience according to their skill. There are five main difficulties in Phasmophobia: Amateur, Intermediate, Professional, Nightmare, and Insanity. Custom difficulties can also be created. Difficulties impact the player, the ghost, and the contract, giving out varying rewards. ==Difficulties== - Intermediate= <blockquote>\"The standard Ghost Huntin' experience\"</blockquote>This difficulty is for the average player who has a good knowledge of the game's mechanics. *Unlocked at level 10 *2x rewards *2-minute setup time *1.5x sanity consumption *Common ghost activity *Medium hunting phase *Sanity Medication restores 35% of sanity *Few doors will start open *25% value of lost items returned to dead players *The fuse box will be off at the start of the game *Some hiding locations will be blocked - Professional= <blockquote>\"For experienced Ghost Hunters\"</blockquote>This difficulty is for experienced players who have a relatively strong foundation in the core mechanics, ghosts, and strategies needed to complete the investigation. *Unlocked at level 20 *3x rewards *No setup time *2x sanity consumption *Uncommon ghost activity *Long hunting phase *Sanity Medication restores 30% of sanity *0% value of lost items returned to dead players *The Fuse Box will be off at the start of the game *The objective board will not specify if the ghost responds to everyone or people who are alone *The ghost room will change rarely *Some doors will start open *Most hiding locations will be blocked - Nightmare= <blockquote>\"A challenge for the best of the best\"</blockquote>This difficulty is a challenge aimed solely at players who know the game's mechanics inside-out, have strong practical experience in ghost hunting, and have a solid strategy or action plan, especially in teams. *Unlocked at level 30 *4x rewards *No setup time *2x sanity consumption *Uncommon ghost activity *Longest hunting phase *Sanity Medication restores 25% of sanity *0% value of lost items returned to dead players *The fuse box will be off at the start of the game *The Objective Board will not specify if the ghost responds to everyone or people who are alone *The ghost room will change occasionally *The Sanity Monitor and Site Activity Monitor will be damaged and display random values *Almost all hiding locations will be blocked *Many doors will start open *The fuse box is not shown on the truck map *A successful kill will extend the hunting phase, allowing multiple kills in a single hunt *The ghost will only provide 2 pieces of evidence instead of 3 - Insanity= <blockquote>\"Feeling brave? These ghosts don't mess around...\"</blockquote>This difficulty is an extremely hard challenge solely aimed at players that have mastered the mechanics of the game from top to bottom.

{"content":"The D.O.T.S Projector is a piece of electronic starter equipment, as well as a type of evidence, that can be used to reveal the ghost's movement. ==Usage== The D.O.T.S Projector can be on a wall or floor similar to a motion sensor. It emits a matrix of bright green laser points in a small area from the projector. Tier I D.O.T.S Projector additionally can be held and to create a cone of D.O.T.S light where it is pointed. The Tier I D.O.T.S Projector will not work if Flashlights are turned off in custom difficulty settings. Ghosts with D.O.T.S evidence will occasionally enter a \"D.O.T.S state\". During this, a faint silhouette of the ghost will be visible only when it passes through the laser grid. The ghost will also walk towards the nearest player if there is one in the same room, or towards a random waypoint if no players are nearby. While these silhouettes are visible to the naked eye (unless the ghost is a Goryo), a video camera with night vision may allow for better visibility. This also means that D.O.T.S can be tracked simultaneously alongside Ghost Orbs. Dead players cannot see the D.O.T.S state by any means. Though the D.O.T.S Projector is an electronic equipment, only the Tier I D.O.T.S. Projector when activated and held will attract the ghost to the player during a hunt, and they are otherwise safe to hold onto. ===Rewards=== The D.O.T.S silhouette can be photographed or video recorded, and will show up as D.O.T.S. Ghost in the journal. Both the photo and the video can reward up to $12 and 12 XP depending on the equipment tier and whether there is a Unique stamp. The photo will complete the \"Capture a photo of the Ghost\" objective and the video will complete the \"Capture a video of a Ghost\" objective. Because of the nature of the D.O.T.S silhouette and the ghost's tendency to move toward the nearest player, the D.O.T.S Ghost video recording is exceedingly hard to get. ==Tips== * A good way to see the D.O.T.S silhouette clearly is to have the room lights turned off and use a video camera with night vision on, then look either directly through the video camera screen or the computer. This will increase the silhouette's contrast against the background. Having two D.O.T.S Projectors placed can allow the silhouette to be visible for longer as it moves across the lighting radius. * If the favourite room is small, consider placing the D.O.T.S Projector in a neighbouring room to aid visibility. * The Projector emits a substantial amount of light when placed. Investigators can use them for illumination, especially with a spare Projector or when D.O.T.S evidence can be safely crossed off. Note that the D.O.T.S projector light does not mitigate sanity drain. * The Tier II and III D.O.T.S Projectors can be placed on some ceilings in a few maps, which may allow the light to cover a room with much more consistency. This is especially useful for the tier III projector, whose sweeping motions and cone-shaped light area can cause the ghost to potentially leave its light prematurely depending on the ghost's and the projector's movement. * The green light emitted may obscure nearby fingerprints or footprints; look carefully or remove the projector when checking for ultraviolet evidence. *Some visual effects such as freezing breath or Incense smoke will reflect the D.O.T.S Projector's light. Be careful to not confuse them with a D.O.T.S silhouette. *There is currently a bug where the ghost can initiate a ghost event or a hunt while in \"D.O.T.S state\". This will make the ghost entirely invisible and nearly quiet (footsteps will not be heard) outside of a D.O.T.S. Projector's range. *The tier III D.O.T.S Projector emits a constant motor whirring sound when active, which can both be quite annoying and interfere with the player's hearing when trying to listen for ghost activity. If you press when pointing at the projector, it will stop in its current position, allowing it to operate in complete silence at the cost of covering a smaller area; interacting again will turn it off completely, and interacting a third time will turn it back on again. *When two D.O.T.S fields overlap, the illuminated ghost may fail to be captured on camera and result in 'blank' photos. When this happens, turn one D.O.T.S. projector off or space them further apart. ==Gallery== <gallery> File:DOTS090_T1_animation.gif|A ghost moving through a Tier 1 D.O.T.S Projector.

{"content":"An Electro-Magnetic Field (short: EMF) is emitted whenever the ghost interacts with its environment. EMF can be read by the EMF Reader, allowing players to deduce the ghost's activities from the EMF Level indicated by the reader. ==EMF emissions== When the ghost performs certain interactions or enters a certain state, it will generate an EMF reading at a certain location depending on the type of action performed. There are four types of EMF emissions: interaction, throwing, manifestations, and evidence. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ ! EMF Level !! Ghost Activity |- !1 |None, default state |- !2 |Interacting with an object<br>Using an ability |- !3 |Throwing an object |- !4 |Manifestation |- !5 |Evidence (33% chance) |} ===Level 1: Default State=== EMF Level 1 is the default level indicated as soon as the EMF Reader is turned on. It has no further significance. ===Level 2: Interaction=== EMF Level 2 generally indicates that the ghost recently interacted with an object in the surrounding environment: *Interacted with a door (including during ghost events) *Interacted with the fuse box *Interacted with a Ghost Writing Book (writing, not throwing) *Interacted with a light switch (outside of ghost events) *Interacted with an appliance or electronic device such as phones or radios *Interacted with a sink *Interacted with a shower *Interacted with a rocking chair *Interacted with a painting *Knocked on a window *Replied to the Ouija Board *Teleported an object *Triggered a Car Alarm *Used a crucifix *Making the room's light flicker For the above interactions, the EMF reading will be tied to where the object is. The ghost blowing out a firelight will also give off EMF Level 2, though this does not count as a true interaction. EMF Level 2 can also indicate that any of the following ghosts used their ability: *Jinn (lowered sanity of nearby players; read from the fuse box) *Phantom (walking to player; read from the ghost's targeted location when it used its ability) *Poltergeist (multiple item throw; an EMF 3 reading will be created for each item thrown) *Wraith (teleporting to player; read from where the ghost teleported to when it used its ability) ===Level 3: Object throw=== EMF Level 3 indicates that a prop (including the Video Camera or a Ghost Writing Book) was recently thrown by the ghost or knocked a painting off of the wall. The EMF reading will be tied to where the object is. ===Level 4: Manifestation=== EMF Level 4 indicates that the ghost initiated a ghost event, with the source of the reading fixed to where the ghost was when the ghost event started. An EMF level 4 reading is also created at the ghost's position where it started a hunt. This reading is usually not discovered, as the ghost's electronic disturbance generally masks it, but it can be detected if the ghost either moves far enough away or the hunt happens to end before the reading expires. ===Level 5: Evidence=== Each EMF Level 2 or 3 occurrence from any source (except interference) has a 33% chance to show up as Level 5 instead if the ghost has the evidence and it is not hidden. It does not necessarily indicate strong activity or immediate danger to the player. While hunting, the ghost will still produce EMF readings when it interacts with the environment (i.e. touching doors, throwing props), although the malfunctioning caused by its presence will usually prevent reading it. This means that EMF Level 5 readings can be observed if the ghost interacts with something, then moves far enough away for the EMF Reader to stop malfunctioning. While malfunctioning, the EMF Reader cannot show up as EMF Level 5. Category:Evidence fr:EMF","title":"EMF","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/EMF"}
{"content":"]] Equipment in Phasmophobia is used to determine the type of ghost inhabiting a location, or to complete optional objectives. Players can purchase equipment using money they receive from successful investigations. ==Mechanics== Equipment may be bought or sold in the Shop when in the lobby. When a player dies, they lose all equipment they added to the mission, excluding the default starter equipment that is always provided. Players who stay alive do not have to collect their equipment at the end of a contract to keep them; they will be returned automatically. Items categorized as consumable (e.g. incense and sanity medication) do not need to be bought again if the player remains alive, but if the player uses them, they need to be rebought. Players can buy and store a maximum of 999 of each item. Ghosts disrupt nearby electronic equipment whenever they are visible, such as during a hunt or when they manifest (i.e. become visible while not hunting). Holding active electronic equipment during a hunt will attract nearby ghosts. There are 3 types of equipment: *Starter equipment *Optional equipment *Truck equipment ==Starter equipment== Starter Equipment is available from the very beginning, and one of each of the following will always be freely included on an investigation, though additional pieces may be purchased and added. {| class=\"fandom-table\" !Equipment !Max limit !Description |- |D.O.T.S.

{"content":"The firelight is a piece of equipment in Phasmophobia. It is a deployable light source that can be lit using a source of fire such as an igniter or another firelight. It can be used to continuously light up a room with a warm, orange glow, and mitigate sanity drain from darkness, until it eventually burns out. Ghosts tend to blow out nearby firelights, making them effective at checking if a ghost is nearby. ==Usage== ===Lighting firelights=== Players can light a firelight held in their hand by pressing if they have an igniter in their inventory. A firelight placed down can be lit while holding an igniter and pressing . One can also hold a lit firelight, aim at an unlit firelight, and use the Secondary Use key. An unorthodox way is to have the wick of one lit and one unlit firelight to collide (this may need velocity). ===Placement=== Firelights can be down on surfaces. Holding the placement key will show a translucent highlight of the firelight. This will place the firelight upright relative to the surface. Firelights can topple/fall over when placed on a slope or vertically. ===Function=== When a player is within 2 metres of a lit firelight, it will slow passive sanity drain that results from being in the dark, at a rate depending on the firelight's tier level. Lit firelights do not affect sanity drain from other sources such as ghost events or other players dying. Ghosts can blow out firelights at any time, even during hunts, and this will create an EMF 2 reading (or EMF Level 5). When blown out, the firelight will be extinguished with a blowing \"sigh\" effect. A firelight will also extinguish by itself at the end of its duration which depends on its tier level. Tier I and Tier II firelights will produce smoke when blown out by the ghost or self-extinguishing. Contrary to fire sources, however, ghosts cannot light firelights up. Like with fire sources, when a firelight is lit up for the first time, there will be a 30-second cooldown before the ghost can attempt to blow it out. After the end of that cooldown or on subsequent lightings, a new cooldown is set with a random duration between 20 and 80 seconds. The Onryo can bypass these cooldowns due to its hunt prevention mechanics. *Note that Tier III firelights will pause the current cooldown if they are turned off by the player or an Onryo's hunt attempt. Ghosts have a 66.67% (2/3) chance to blow out a lit firelight provided they are within 5 meters and the cooldown is over. *Tier II firelights are more likely to be blown out due to them having three candles, each rolling the same 66.67% chance and if one of the three chances is successful, all three candles are blown out, roughly making it a 96.30% chance overall. Despite being multiple candles, the tier II firelight still counts as one flame for the Onryo. a lit firelight/one falling with sufficient velocity (Tiers I and II only), placing it in the inventory, leaving it out in heavy rain (Tiers I and II only), or pressing while held in hand will cause it to extinguish. ==Tips== *Placing firelights on the sides of tables, shelves, or other elevated objects may improve their lighting by covering a wider area. *In larger maps like Brownstone High School or Sunny Meadows Mental Institution, firelights may be helpful as navigation markers for important areas such as the fuse box, ghost room, or exit door(s), also providing some helpful sanity drain reduction as a bonus, though they are not as reliable as spare UV lights or flashlights, as firelights both burn out after a time (except for tier III) and can be blown out by the ghost. *As non-electronics, firelights are less affected by hunts (other than potentially being blown out), neither do they attract the ghost. Players may use firelights as constant light sources to navigate during hunts. A potential but generally trivial downside is that it removes a source of alert as to whether the ghost is hunting (or performing ghost events). ==Objectives== {| class=\"article-table\" !

{"content":"A dead body is the corpse of a player that was killed by the ghost during a hunt, drew The Hanged Man tarot card or died from the negative effect of the revival wish from the monkey paw. It will usually have a twisted and elongated neck and remain at that player's place of death until the end of the game. ==Mechanics== During the process of death, the player who died will be teleported to the \"death room\". At the same time, a body will appear with their hands writhing around their neck, before dropping dead. The player can be revived by drawing tarot cards, via the The High Priestess card, or using the Monkey Paw's revival wish (which also has a 50% chance to simultaneously kill the wisher). ===Rewards=== Taking a photo of a dead body or filming the death of a player will respectively yield a Dead Body photo rewarding up to $7 and 7 XP, and a Dead Body video rewarding up to $12 and 12 XP, depending on the equipment tier and whether there is a Unique stamp. ==Trivia== *Taking a photo of the dead body does not affect the dead player's insurance. *There used to be a bug where taking a photo of the bin outside 42 Edgefield Road would count as a dead body photo.

{"content":"The fuse box, breaker, or generator is found on maps and may be turned on or off to power the lights. Ghosts can also interact with the fuse box. ==Mechanics== Each map will always have one fuse box that will spawn in one of multiple rooms. The location of the fuse box is indicated on the Site Map, except on Nightmare and Insanity difficulties where it is not indicated. The fuse box model differs depending on the type of map. At the beginning of the game, the fuse box is turned on by default in Amateur difficulty and turned off by default in all other difficulties. This can additionally be changed to Broken by using the 'Fuse box at start of contract' setting for Custom difficulties, where sparks will fly out of the fuse box, and it cannot be toggled on. Using the Monkey Paw's 'activity' wish will also break the fuse box. The player can turn on and off the fuse box by: *Opening the cover, then clicking the small switch (Small houses & Farmhouses) *Clicking on the red box (Prison and Brownstone High School) *Clicking on the generator (Campsites) *Clicking on the lever (Sunny Meadows Mental Institution) The fuse box affects the following electrical equipment: *All light switches/sources (including lamps and lanterns) *Televisions *Computers *(Other environmental details or lighting) A direct interaction with the fuse box, whether it be by the ghost or a player, does not change the state of any electrical equipment (light switches will remain in their on/off state). The fuse box can support a maximum number of lights, depending on map size: *Small maps: 9 *Medium maps: 8 *Large maps: 7 This refers to the number of light sources that can be turned on, regardless of their type and their number of bulbs. If the number of light sources turned on is greater than the map's limit, the fuse box will instantly turn off, and all lights will be reset to the off position. Temperature is affected by the fuse box's state. When it is on, the temperature within indoor areas will slowly rise to . When it is off, the temperature will slowly drop to the ambient temperature, which depends on the weather. Outdoor temperatures are not affected. ===Ghost interactions=== When a ghost performs an interaction, it has a chance of interacting with the fuse box remotely. Most ghosts can turn on and off the fuse box. This will generate an EMF Level 2 reading at the fuse box, with a 33% chance for this to be EMF Level 5 for ghosts with this evidence. Where applicable, ghosts can also interact with the fuse box's door. The ghost must be nearby for this to happen. Some ghosts have special interactions or abilities concerning the fuse box: *The Jinn will never turn off the fuse box directly (but it can still trip). If the fuse box is on, the Jinn can: **Chase players in line-of-sight further than 3 metres at a fixed speed of 2.5 m/s **Occasionally use a special ability to drain the sanity of a nearby player by 25% *The Hantu cannot turn on the fuse box and has a doubled chance of turning it off. **If it is hunting while the fuse box is off or broken, it will emit freezing breath near its ghost model's head. ===Related custom difficulty options=== *Fuse box at start of contract: Broken/Off/On *Fuse box visible on map: Off/On (option only shows if 'Fuse box at start of contract' is not set to Broken) ==Gallery== <gallery orientation=\"Square\"> Maple_generator_on_0.4.0.png|The generator for Maple Lodge Campsite.

{"content":"Ultraviolet is a type of evidence created by ghosts that can be used to determine the ghost type. ==Mechanics== Ultraviolet evidence consists of fingerprints and footprints which can be revealed by using a UV Light. ===Fingerprints=== By default, each interaction on a valid surface will always produce a fingerprint. Exceptions include with the Obake which has a 25% chance to hide them, or when using the \"Fingerprint chance\" custom difficulty modifier to reduce the odds. A ghost with Ultraviolet evidence will leave behind fingerprints when it interacts with the following surfaces or items: *Most types of doors *Light switches and lamps *Windows *Keyboards *TV remotes *Cooler boxes *Mirrors (specific maps only) The Prison map has additional places where fingerprints may be left behind: *On the horizontal surface of a bar of cell doors *On the steel keyhole surface of cell doors Maple Lodge Campsite and Camp Woodwind also have additional places where fingerprints may appear: *Bases of lanterns *Interior edges around large tent door flaps/tops of small tent door flaps *Picnic benchtops *String light poles Lights flickering or interactions caused by ghost events will not result in a fingerprint being left behind in these instances. Depending on the surface area of the object being interacted with, either a fingerprint or a handprint will be visible. Fingerprints will disappear completely after 2 minutes, or 1 minute on Insanity difficulty. This can be changed using a custom difficulty setting. Additionally, the Obake can sometimes use an ability to reduce the remaining time for all existing fingerprints on the map by half. There are 18 different fingerprint patterns, including 3 which are unique to the Obake. When leaving fingerprints on surfaces it touches, an Obake has an approximately 16.7% chance to leave a non-standard pattern: *A handprint with six fingers instead of five *Two fingerprints instead of one on light switches, lamps, and TV remotes *Five fingerprints instead of four on keyboards and Prison doors For each type of door or surface that a fingerprint is possible, the fingerprint will always appear in the same spot. In addition, most doors of the same model will always have the fingerprints on only the push or pull side, but not both. For example, all Farmhouse-style doors will always have the fingerprints on the top-right corner of the door, and only appear on the \"push\" side. There are a few exceptions to these two rules; for example, one street/road house-style door may have the fingerprint on the \"push\" side while another identical door has it on the \"pull\" side, though they will always appear on the middle of the door. ===Footprints=== When a ghost moves any time within 10 seconds after it steps in a salt pile, it will leave a footprint with each step until it stops moving, and each footprint will produce a footstep sound and disappear after 10 to 15 seconds. If the ghost doesn't have Ultraviolet as evidence, or the evidence is hidden, its footprints will be invisible. *The Obake has a 25% chance each step to hide the footprint, creating no footstep sound when successful. Because of the random nature of the game, a ghost may step in a salt pile and choose to stop moving immediately, creating no footprints in that instance. Footprints left by the \"lamprey-faced\" child ghost model are slightly smaller than those left by other ghost models. ===Rewards=== Taking a photo of a fingerprint or a footprint that has been charged using a UV Light will respectively yield a photo labelled as Fingerprint or Footprint, each rewarding up to $7 and 7 XP, depending on the tier of the Photo Camera and whether there is a Unique stamp. Keep in mind, however, that the prints will slowly fade before becoming completely invisible after the player stops charging them with a UV Light. Invisible prints cannot be photographed and will result in an invalid photo. Each instance of a fingerprint, including repeat fingerprints on the same surface, can only be photographed once. ==Possible ghosts== {|class=\"article-table\" |Banshee |Ultraviolet |D.O.T.S.

For this to happen, the ghost must be The Mimic, it must be mimicking a Yurei, it must use the door-closing ability on the exit door, and the Ultraviolet evidence is not hidden. Hence, this occurrence is very rare. ==Related difficulty settings== *Fingerprint chance (%): The chance of a ghost leaving fingerprints when interacting (only shows when Evidence given is not 0) *Fingerprint duration (s): The duration of fingerprints before they disappear (only shows when Evidence given is not 0) ==History== {|class=\"fandom-table\" !colspan=\"2\"|Early Access Alpha |- !29 January 2020 |Fingerprints now only show on doors that have been interacted with by the ghost rather than being on walls. |- !19 March 2020 |Fingerprints can now appear on windows. |- !11 August 2020 |Fingerprints can now appear on light switches. |- !colspan=\"2\"|Early Access |- !0.2 |Fingerprints can now appear on Prison keyboards. |- !0.3.0 |Updated footprint visuals. |- !rowspan=\"3\"|0.4.0 |Fingerprints now disappear after 60 seconds. |- |Fingerprints are now left only 75% of the time. |- |Added a new fingerprint design for Maple Lodge Campsite. |- !rowspan=\"3\"|0.4.1.0 |Increased the fingerprint duration to 2 minutes. |- |Fingerprints are now left 100% of the time again. |- |Fingerprints can now be found on more surfaces in Maple Lodge Campsite. |- !rowspan=\"2\"|0.6.0 |Added new fingerprint designs. |- |Fingerprints can now appear on house keyboards. |- !rowspan=\"3\"|0.8.1.0 |Fingerprints will now slowly fade out, instead of disappearing instantly. |- |Footprints now fade over time, instead of disappearing instantly. |- |Improved fingerprint and footprint rendering. |- !rowspan=\"5\"|0.9.0 |Renamed Fingerprints evidence to Ultraviolet evidence. |- |Footprints now count as Ultraviolet evidence. |- |Salt will now only reveal footprints if the ghost has Ultraviolet evidence |- |Renamed Footsteps photo to Footprints |- |Footprints will be affected by ghost traits similar to Fingerprints |- !0.10.0 |Ghosts can now leave single fingerprints on all small lamps and TV remotes in all locations |} Category:Evidence fr:Ultraviolet ru:Отпечатки","title":"Ultraviolet","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Ultraviolet"}
{"content":"Doors are map elements that play an important role in Phasmophobia. They are crucial to the game's mechanics and provide help during investigations. ==Types of doors== All maps contain doors of some sort. There are three types of doors in the game: hiding spot (locker/closet/small tent flap), passageway (room/hallway/stall/cell) and exit/entrance. Each of them serves a different purpose. Non-VR players can use the button on a door and move their view in a sweeping manner to open or close the door. VR players can aim for the door to do so. VR players cannot move doors with a non-empty hand. ===Hiding spot doors=== Like the name implies, these doors serve to protect hidden players. Both players and ghosts have to manipulate hiding spot doors in order to open or close them. Ghosts will usually not enter hiding spots when hunting because they don't need to: a ghost can reach out and kill the player just as these doors are in open position. Therefore, the challenge for the players is to keep these doors closed for as much as possible and as long as they remain hidden. ===Passageway doors=== Passageway doors will usually (but not always) delimit a room/area and serve as sight blockers. Unlike players, ghosts can phase through passageway doors, both during and outside of hunts. However, just like with hiding spot doors, ghosts cannot see through passageway doors. The only exception to that is the Deogen, who can set waypoints to the closest player's location, disregarding sight rules. ===Exit doors=== Exit doors can be locked or unlocked by players or the game itself. They separate the \"investigation area\" from the safe, outdoors sections of the maps, trapping the ghost inside its confines, and additionally trapping players inside the investigation area during hunts. The cabin door on Maple Lodge Campsite or the wing doors in Sunny Meadows Mental Institution are not exit doors, though they can be locked (and in a couple of cases separate indoor and outdoor sections of the map) and are instead passageway doors. ==Gameplay mechanics== All doors are interactable and additional elements to an investigation: *Depending on the difficulty, a random number of doors will be open or ajar at the start of the game. This is important because a wide open passageway door, or several wide open hiding spot doors, tend to indicate the ghost is likely within the immediate area. If many doors are selected to be randomly opened at the start of the game, players will have a harder time finding the ghost through this method. *Since version 0.6.1.0, the ghost will perform special checks to look for players behind open passageway doors. This was done for balancing reasons as to discourage players from hiding behind open doors (especially those opening against walls). *Ghosts will sporadically interact with doors. Ghosts will loudly rattle doors before either closing or opening them, producing an interaction and potentially giving out certain evidence, such as an EMF Level 2 reading (33% chance of being EMF Level 5) or Ultraviolet, for applicable ghosts. *During certain ghost events, all passageway doors in the room/area (including the exit door, if applicable) will close. This does not affect hiding spot doors. *When a hunt begins, all exit doors and wing doors in Sunny Meadows will close and lock for the duration of the hunt. This is also not considered as an interaction. *Ghosts cannot interact with doors that are being held by a player. There are some exceptions: **Ghosts can forcefully open a hiding spot door if a player has been detected inside a closet/locker. **Ghosts can forcefully close a passageway door if a player has been detected near an opened one. ===Rewards=== Recording a moving door with a Video Camera will create a Door Moved video in the Journal, rewarding up to $7 and 7 XP. The video evidence is valid as soon as the door starts rattling. If the ghost has Ultraviolet evidence, the ghost has a chance to leave fingerprints on the door. In this case, players may reveal the fingerprints using a UV Light before snapping a quick photo labelled Fingerprints. ==Related difficulty settings== *Doors starting open: How many doors are randomly moved at the start of the contract ==Trivia== *Players used to be able to pull most doors off of their hinges by walking into them from a certain angle. While it did not prevent the ghost from opening or closing them, this glitch could be abused in order to go through walls or go out of bounds, such as going onto the roof of 6 Tanglewood Drive by using the locker doors in the garage. This has been fixed in 0.11.0. Category:Map Features fr:Porte","title":"Door","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Door"}
{"content":"The ID Card is a cosmetic that shows the player's in-game progress. ==Features== The ID card shows the name of the player, the platform they're playing on (Steam, PlayStation, or Xbox), their level, the player's badge, and their selected character model. For the player's own ID card, the bar shows the amount of experience needed to level up. When looking at other players' ID cards, the bar is used to adjust their voice chat volume. By default, the volume is set to 50%. The character model can be changed by clicking on the model portrait, and a player's badge can be changed by clicking the customize button in the top right corner. ===Roles=== By default, players are assigned the Ghost Huntin' Intern role. Different roles can be obtained through the prestige system, holiday events, contributing to the development of the game, being a Kinetic Games Partner, or through community-related events. Players that obtain a new role will also obtain a new badge that the role is linked to. The badge must be displayed on a player's profile to display the role. ===Prestige Badges=== Upon reaching Level 100 the player has the option to Prestige. Players will receive a new badge every Prestige that affects the role and color of the ID Card. Prestige Badges will also be displayed on the left shoulder of the player's character model, below the Legacy Badge. A player's prestige level will appear as Roman numerals prefixing their level (i.e. VI-002). Prestiges 1-10 display an ID Card with a static background and badge, while prestiges 11-20 display an ID Card with an animated background and badge. <table-progress-tracking table-id=\"1\" unique-column-index=\"3\"> {| class=\"fandom-table\" !Role !ID Card design !Prestige |- |Intern | |Prestige 0 (Default) |- |<span style=\"color: #E7A638;\">Recruit</span> | |Prestige 1 (I) |- |<span style=\"color: #DA3382;\">Investigator</span> | |Prestige 2 (II) |- |<span style=\"color: #ECBF5D;\">Pvt.

{"content":"The Haunted Mirror is a cursed possession that can be used to locate the ghost's favorite room. ==Mechanics== A haunted mirror has a 1 in 7 chance per contract of being chosen as the cursed possession that will spawn on a default difficulty, with one specific spawn location per map. ===Activation and usage=== The mirror can be while inside the investigation area. It will be automatically deactivated when brought outside. When activated, the haunted mirror will show a view of the favorite room as a sweeping panorama from the center of the room, allowing players to locate the room by cross-reference. This view is a live feed of the room, so any lights turned on, items moved, and equipment or players present in the room will be visible. The only exception is the player's own model. The mirror also gives a faint glow to see into the favorite room, which all players, including the user, can see, even outside of the mirror. This can help confirm rooms, as well as help other players know where the favorite room is. Each usage of the haunted mirror, which includes the animation of raising but not of lowering the mirror, will decrease sanity at a rate of 7.5% per second, or by 20%, whichever is higher. This means that using the mirror for less than ~2.67 seconds will still drain at least 20% sanity. The mirror will crack visually and audibly, triggering a cursed hunt if: *The user's sanity reaches 0% while looking into the mirror *A player activates the mirror while below 20% sanity Once broken, the mirror automatically lowers and cannot be used for the rest of the investigation. ===Rewards=== Taking a photo of a haunted mirror, cracked or not, will yield a photo labelled as Haunted Mirror, and reward up to $7 and 7 XP, depending on the tier of the Photo Camera. ==Tips== *On maps such as Brownstone High School where many rooms look very similar, it may be hard to confirm the favorite room; players can place some equipment in the room they suspect to be the favorite room, and see if said equipment is visible in the mirror. Alternatively, players can also memorize small details such as the position and placement of windows, or the tile color, before searching that room. *If the \"Eye Adaption\" option is on, the player's vision will be significantly darkened for a short while after lowering down the mirror. Turn this option off if it becomes troublesome. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !0.5.0 |Added Haunted Mirror as a cursed possession. |- !0.5.0.2 |The mirror's view into the favourite room will now keep rotating instead of resetting on every use. |- !0.8.0.3 |The mirror now drains at least 20% sanity per use. |- !0.9.5.0 |The Haunted Mirror will now correctly break straight away if you do not have enough sanity (20%). |}<br> Category:Item fr:Miroir hanté ru:Зачарованное зеркало","title":"Haunted Mirror","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Haunted_Mirror"}
{"content":"The Head Gear is a type of equipment in Phasmophobia. Its specific function varies based on its equipment tier, though generally it improves the ability to investigate without a Flashlight. ==Usage== a head gear will put it on the player's head. The head gear can be toggled on or off by holding the key for a couple of seconds. It can be back at any time. Worn Head Gear does not take up an inventory slot. The camera's display moves relative to the direction that the player's model is facing. Activated Head Gear will attract the ghost during hunts, similar to other electronic equipment. ==Mechanics== ===Tier I=== Tier I Head Gear is the Head Mounted Camera. When activated, it functionally serves as a portable Video Camera, and can be used to help teams track each other and to see Ghost Orbs. Although useless when playing alone, they can be handy in a team with an observer in the Truck. Like with regular video cameras, Head Mounted Cameras can switch between visual and night-vision modes at the Computer, and can be used to detect Ghost Orbs when in night vision mode. They are also handy for monitoring players who have to be alone to get ghost responses, such as when using a Spirit Box, and are very useful for guiding players around larger maps, especially in the dark, since the player in the truck can see with night vision mode even if all the lights in the location are out, as well as having access to the Site Map. When the player equips the Tier I Head Gear, the player can see a big box-like object above the field of view. If it is activated, a red indicator light will start to blink. ===Tier II=== Tier II Head Gear is the Head Lamp. When activated, it provides a light source emanating from the player's head, with comparable power and illumination to the Tier I Flashlight. The Tier II Head Gear is not visible in the player's field of view unless the player starts to sprint. Even while sprinting, the player can hardly see a part of it. ===Tier III=== Tier III Head Gear is the Night Vision Goggles. When activated, it brightens visibility substantially, painting the player's view light green and allowing them to see in the dark, at the expense of added film grain, lowered render scale, and a slight fish-eye effect, altogether reducing the player's ability to see as far as they could have, and clearly. The display through Tier III Head Gear is a filter through normal vision, rather than a proper separate display as seen in a Video Camera in night-vision mode; an active UV Light will project a definite purple light, when through the video camera's night vision it would be white like from a (visible light spectrum) Flashlight, and Ghost Orbs cannot be seen through just the view provided by the goggles. The Tier III Head Gear filters out red lights. This makes EMF Level 5 on a Tier II EMF Reader appear identical to EMF 4, or the Spirit Box's red lights to not be visible. When the player equips the Tier III Head Gear, the player can see a big goggle-like object above the field of view. ==Trivia== *The Tier I Head Gear appears to be closely modeled on a GoPro Hero 4 Silver Edition. *The Tier III Head Gear is likely modeled after the real life Sightmark SM15070 \"Ghost Hunter\" Night Vision Goggles. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |0.9.0 |Head Mounted Cameras were renamed to Head Gear. |- |The Head Gear now has 3 tiers. |- ! rowspan=\"3\" |0.10.0 |A customizable keybinding has been added to the Controls page for turning on and off Head Gear. |- |Turning Head Gear I on and off will now play different sounds to help know which state the equipment is in. |- |While within range of a ghost event or hunting ghost: * Tier III will now have visual interference * All tiers will now play a new sound |- |}<br> Category:Equipment fr:Équipement de tête ru:Крепление на голову","title":"Head Gear","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Head_Gear"}
{"content":"<div class=\"mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"width:400px; margin-left:1%; float:right; text-align:right\"> <span style=\"color:#efcf00\">This image has flashing lights.</span><div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\"></div> </div> The hunt is an in-game mechanic intended to complicate further investigation of a location by the player(s). During hunts, the ghost will materialize itself and proceed to roam around the location in order to kill one or more players. For the duration of the hunt, all exit doors will become locked and the ghost will cause all nearby lights and electronic equipment to malfunction. A cursed hunt is a variant of a hunt caused by cursed possessions. Mechanic-wise, cursed hunts are mostly similar to regular hunts. ==Initiating a hunt== ===Standard protections=== Hunts cannot occur while the setup phase is ongoing. The duration of the setup phase by difficulty is as follows: {| class=\"article-table\" !Difficulty !Duration of setup phase |- |Amateur |5 minutes |- |Intermediate |2 minutes |- |Professional<br>Nightmare<br>Insanity |No setup phase |} The setup phase can be ended early if a cursed possession is used or activated. Once a hunt ends, there is a minimum cooldown of 25 seconds (20 seconds for a Demon) before the ghost can attempt to initiate another hunt. This does not affect the activation of cursed hunts. Ghosts do not necessarily hunt immediately once this cooldown is over. ===Regular hunt requirements=== At least one player must be within the investigation area for a hunt to begin. All ghosts have a sanity hunt threshold below which they will be able to hunt, and some ghosts may have abilities which may modify the threshold, or even override it entirely. Using \"trigger words\" or swearing does not increase the chance of a hunt. ====Hunt sanity thresholds==== For most ghosts, the average team sanity is used to determine whether the ghost can hunt. The average sanity is of all players who are alive, regardless of whether they are inside or outside the investigation area. Dead players do not count towards the average team sanity. For most ghosts, the hunt sanity threshold is 50%; ghosts can choose to initiate hunts at random once the average sanity is at or below 50%. Generally, a lower average sanity increases the frequency of hunts, but other factors may affect this. The following table lists the hunt sanity thresholds and abilities for all ghosts: {| class=\"article-table\" style=\"margin: auto;\" !Ghost !Condition !Hunt sanity threshold<br>(if non-standard) (%) !Non-threshold based ability/<br>additional notes |- |Banshee |Always |Standard |Only checks target's sanity |- | rowspan=\"2\" |Dayan |When a nearby player is moving |65 | |- |When a nearby player is still |45 | |- | rowspan=\"2\" |Demon |On ability phase activation |N/A |Hunts regardless of sanity<br>Can use its ability during the setup phase, but it will not hunt. |- |Always |70 | |- |Deogen |Always |40 | |- | rowspan=\"2\" |Gallu |In \"enraged\" state |60 | |- |In \"weakened\" state |40 | |- | rowspan=\"2\" |Mare |Lights turned off or broken at ghost's current room |60 | |- |Lights turned on at ghost's current room |40 |Regardless of fuse box status |- | rowspan=\"2\"|Obambo |In \"aggressive\" state |65 | |- |In \"calm\" state |10 | |- | rowspan=\"3\" |Onryo |Every third flame blown out and no other flame nearby |N/A |Hunts regardless of sanity |- |Always |60 | |- |Near a flame |40 | |- |Raiju |In the presence of active electronic equipment |65 | |- | rowspan=\"2\" |Shade |Always |35 | |- |At least one player in ghost's current room |N/A |Does not hunt regardless of sanity |- | rowspan=\"3\" |Thaye |Initial threshold (Age 0) |75 | |- |Modifier per age added (Age +1) | -6 | |- |Final threshold (Age 10) |15 | |- |The Mimic | colspan=\"3\" |Inherits hunt thresholds & abilities of currently-mimicked ghost |- |Yokai |At least one player uses voice chat nearby |80 | |- |All other ghosts/<br>standard |Always |50 | |} ===Cursed hunts=== Cursed hunts can only be initiated directly by using cursed possessions. Cursed hunts ignore sanity thresholds and hunt cooldowns; they can start right after a normal hunt, but normal hunts respect the cooldown after cursed hunts. Cancelled cursed hunts (due to empty locations) don't count toward the cooldown timer. ===Activity=== During hunts, the activity monitor shows level 10. However, activity level doesn't indicate hunting probability, and level 10 readings don't always mean a hunt is occurring. ===Preventing a hunt=== Hunt prevention equipment: *Crucifix: Stops hunts if ghost is within range when attempting to hunt. Ghost must wait 25 seconds (20 for Demon) before trying again. Tier I prevents 1 hunt; Tiers II and III prevent 2 hunts. *Fire sources: A lit fire source, such as a firelight or a campfire, within 4 meters of an Onryo prevents hunting, but the Onryo can blow out flames, potentially triggering a hunt regardless of sanity. *Incense: Prevents hunt initiation for varying durations when lit within 3-5 meters (tier-dependent) of the ghost: **Demon: 60 seconds **Spirit: 180 seconds **All other ghosts: 90 seconds *Monkey Paw: \"I wish to trap the ghost\" prevents hunting for 1 minute but triggers a guaranteed hunt immediately afterward. Cursed hunts can only be prevented by a tier III crucifix with two charges remaining. Incense blinds ghosts during cursed hunts but won't prevent them. ==Start of a hunt== Each hunt consists of a grace period (not to be confused with the cooldown between hunts) and the actual hunting phase. During the grace period, the ghost will remain invisible and still for a number of seconds, giving players a chance to escape before it begins chasing them. All exit doors lock at the beginning of the grace period, preventing players from entering or exiting the investigation area. The duration of this grace period depends on difficulty or the type of the hunt: *Amateur: 5 seconds *Intermediate: 4 seconds *Professional: 3 seconds *Nightmare: 2 seconds *Insanity: 2 seconds *Cursed hunt: 1 second *Custom: 0 - 5 seconds The ghost cannot detect or see players during this grace period. Subsequent hunts after a cursed hunt, where not activated by a cursed possession again, are not \"true\" cursed hunts and hence revert to the difficulty-based grace period. The duration of a hunt depends on the difficulty and the map size. These are as follows, excluding the grace period: {| class=\"article-table\" style=\"margin: auto;\" ! rowspan=\"2\" |Difficulty ! colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |Duration of hunt |- !Small map !Medium map !Large map |- |Amateur<br>Hunt duration: Low |15 seconds |30 seconds |40 seconds |- |Intermediate<br>Hunt duration: Medium |20 seconds |40 seconds |50 seconds |- |Professional<br>Nightmare<br>Insanity<br>Hunt duration: High |30 seconds |50 seconds |1 minute |}<br>After a cursed hunt is initiated, all subsequent hunts in the same contract, whether regular or cursed, including the ongoing cursed hunt, will last 20 seconds longer than the original duration. The hunt duration is the same for all ghosts. If the Kills extend hunts setting is not off, each successful kill will extend the current hunt duration: {| class=\"article-table\" style=\"margin: auto;\" ! rowspan=\"2\" |Difficulty ! colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Added duration |- !Small map !Medium map !Large map |- |Nightmare<br>Insanity<br>Kills extend hunts: Low |15 seconds |20 seconds |25 seconds |- |Kills extend hunts: Medium |25 seconds |30 seconds |35 seconds |- |Kills extend hunts: High |35 seconds |40 seconds |45 seconds |} <br>Using the Monkey Paw's \"I wish to leave\" wish will unlock all exit doors even during a hunt, but with temporary side effects. Hunts always initiate from wherever the ghost is standing (except for The Twins in specific cases); it does not have to start from any specific room. Once the grace period begins, an EMF 4 signal will be emitted at the point where the ghost is standing. ==Ghost movement== Once the grace period ends, the ghost will proceed to either wander in a random direction, or chase a player. Ghosts cannot teleport during hunts. Within the investigation area, the ghost is able to access practically all places that players can access. It may also phase through certain furniture such as doors, some beds, and some clutter. The ghost cannot physically enter closets, lockers and mini tents, though it can stand in front of (and appear to be partially inside) one. ===Wandering=== In a \"wandering\" (or \"roaming\") phase where the ghost is not aware of any player, the ghost randomly selects a waypoint on the map, moves to that waypoint, then repeats. The ghost always attempts to take the shortest path to its waypoint. ===Chasing phase=== If the ghost detects a player, its \"wandering\" phase will be disrupted and it will enter a \"chasing\" phase, setting a waypoint at the player's last known location. If it reaches the waypoint, it will repeat this action until it is unable to detect any player, upon which it will search in the immediate vicinity, before returning to its \"wandering\" phase. If multiple players are detected at the same time (such as a Deogen which immediately detects all players after the grace period ends), it will set a waypoint at the nearest player by straight-line distance. The following actions attract the ghost: ;Being seen by the ghost *Each player has a total of 6 tracking points, split into 2 groups of 3, each on the upper and lower parts of the hitbox. This is anchored to the player's current point-of-view. The ghost is considered to be able to see the player, or achieving line-of-sight (LoS), if it can see all 3 points of one group (e.g. seeing 2 upper group points and 2 lower group points does not count). The placement of these tracking points means that having the head poke through a closed closet will not allow the ghost to see non-VR players, but VR players could possibly be seen, since they are actually looking through the closet. *The ghost has a 360-degree vision. *The ghost can see players up to 75 meters away. *Each ghost model has the same \"head\" height. If the ghost is a crawling model, LoS will still be achieved as if the ghost was standing. *Most physical objects or structures, except throwable objects, will block LoS. This includes glass windows and doors, and cell walls and doors in Prison. ;Voice communications *During a hunt, ghosts can hear players up to 9 meters away on the same floor. *Whether the ghost can hear the player is dictated by their voice chat settings. When voice chat is activated, any sound above a certain volume, whether from the player talking or background noise, will attract the ghost within the specified distance. *Using global chat within 9 meters of the ghost, even without talking, will attract it to the player using it. This does not attract the ghost to other players; players outside the investigation area using global chat will not cause players inside to die. ;Active electronic equipment *The ghost will be attracted by any active electronic equipment held by players in their hand, placed on the VR toolbelt, or being worn on their head, within 7.5 meters of it on the same floor during a hunt. Items that do not make any noise such as flashlights or thermometers will still attract the ghost. Regular flashlights (but not UV flashlights) that are swapped into the inventory but still turned on will also attract the ghost. *Equipment dropped on the floor or offhand, as well as deactivated Head Gear that is still being worn, do not attract the ghost. *The player model always has a default, short shoulder flashlight (different from the ones collected from the truck wall). This small flashlight is always turned on and does not attract the ghost. For comparison, the normal electronic interference range is 10 meters. Voice communication and electronic detection are similar in terms of detection priority. If the ghost is considered to be on a different floor from the player, the ghost can only detect the player through LoS. Otherwise, the ghost will not be able to detect the player through other methods. The following do not attract the ghost: *Footsteps; *Door, closet and locker noises; *Electronics on the floor, even when turned on; *Electronics that are held and turned off; *Crucifixes; *Lit incense; *Firelights and glowsticks, even when lit; *Players outside the investigation area (except Deogen in some cases). ====Special detection cases==== =====Waypoint memory between hunts===== During the hunt, the ghost will remember the last seen location of a player before the hunt ended. When a new hunt starts, the ghost first has a 50% chance to set a waypoint at this location. This may include the location of a player it killed. If there is no such instance or otherwise, the ghost will \"forget\" this location and proceed with either regular wandering or chasing. *This is not relevant when the ghost is not hunting; the ghost does not remember player locations outside of a hunt. It is theoretically safe to hide in a closet or locker indefinitely if the doors remain closed and the player avoids being seen, since ghosts cannot walk into them. *The ghost can only remember one waypoint per hunt; the same waypoint does not carry across multiple hunts. =====Detection in hiding spots with doors===== If the player is detected in a closet, locker, or small tent, the ghost will set a waypoint just outside that location, then force open the door(s) of that hiding spot when it arrives, overriding the player holding the door if applicable. This usually results in death unless the player is standing in such a way that delays LoS from being achieved, and they can close the closet door again fast enough. =====Hiding behind opened room doors===== If there is an opened room door in the ghost's interaction range, it will check if there are players nearby. If this is true, it will roam to the player's location and forcefully close the door, similar to how ghosts open closet/locker doors if a player is detected inside. =====Smudging===== If the ghost is within range of a burning Incense, regardless of who is holding the Incense, and is successfully \"pinged\", the ghost will be unable to detect or kill players for 5 seconds, causing it to enter the \"wandering\" phase. When the effect ends, it will be able to detect and kill players again, resuming its normal hunting behaviour. The Incense technically does not \"repel\" the ghost away from the player, only that it will randomly set a new waypoint which may or may not be in the same direction as the player. =====Monkey Paw===== Using the Monkey Paw's \"I wish to be safe\" will enable the ghost to detect the wisher's voice and electronics from infinite range (including from different floors) for the rest of the contract. =====Ghost-specific detection behaviours===== Some ghosts have different behaviours in terms of detecting players during hunts: *If the Banshee's target is currently within the investigation area, it cannot detect nor kill non-targets. *The Deogen always has LoS with all players, meaning it always knows everyone's location. *Blinding the Moroi using Incense is effective for 50% longer. *The Yokai can only detect voices and electronics within 2.5 meters of it, instead of the respective 9 and 7.5 metres. ===Ghost speeds=== <small>The speeds listed below assume a default Ghost speed (%) setting of 100. The speeds will scale accordingly if this setting is changed.</small> Most ghosts move at a base speed of 1.7 m/s. If a ghost maintains active line-of-sight (LoS) with a player it is chasing, its speed will gradually increase at a rate of 0.05 times its base speed per second, taking up to 13 seconds to reach the cap of 1.65 times its base speed. If it loses detection of a player, it will maintain the speed until it gives up its \"immediate area search\", thereafter slowly decreasing its speed at 0.01 times its base speed per second. This takes 65 seconds to return to base speed if from maximum speed. Ghosts do not carry over their speed across hunts. The following ghosts obey LoS, but have additional modifiers that may or may not conditionally override it: *The Dayan moves at a fixed speed of 2.25 m/s (overriding LoS acceleration) if a player is moving within 10 metres, or at a fixed speed of 1.2 m/s (also overriding LoS acceleration) if the player is standing still within 10 metres. It obeys normal ghost speeds if there is no player within 10 metres. *The Jinn moves at a fixed speed of 2.5 m/s (overriding LoS acceleration) if it has LoS with a player, that player is further than 3 meters away, and the fuse box is on. It obeys normal ghost speeds if any of these conditions are not met. *The Raiju moves at a fixed speed of 2.5 m/s (overriding LoS acceleration) if it is within a certain distance of any active electronic equipment. It obeys normal speeds outside of the radius. The following ghosts ignore standard LoS speed rules: *The Deogen moves slower the shorter its pathing distance is to the player; its speed ranges from 0.4 m/s (within 2.5 meters of the player) to 3 m/s (further than 6 meters). If it is not chasing anyone (e.g. when smudged), it stays at its previous speed, or 1.6 m/s if its previous speed was higher than 3 m/s. *The Hantu's speed increases the lower the room temperature is, going from a minimum of 1.4 m/s to a maximum of 2.7 m/s. *The Revenant moves at 1 m/s if it has not detected any player. If it detects a player, it will move at 3 m/s until it reaches the last known position of the player, before decelerating at a rate of 0.75 m/s² (for ~2.7 s) back to 1 m/s. *The Thaye's speed is fixed at 2.75 m/s initially. Every time it ages, this speed decreases by 0.175 m/s; it will reach 1 m/s once it has aged completely.<ref name=\"24_patch\" /> Additionally, if the weather is Blood Moon, the ghost's speed is increased by 15%. For comparison, the player walks at 1.6 m/s and can sprint at 3 m/s for 3 seconds with a 5-second cooldown, resulting in an average speed of 2.125 m/s if continuously sprinting off-cooldown. ==Interacting with objects== Ghosts are able to perform interactions during hunts. There are similarities and differences from non-hunt interactions: *All ghosts have a 50% chance (100% chance for Poltergeist) of throwing one object near them (within their interaction range) every 0.5 seconds during hunts, 4 seconds after the beginning of the hunt. *Ghosts can interact with all types of doors, except exit doors and other types of furniture doors. If a ghost with the Ultraviolet evidence interacts with a door, it will leave the evidence accordingly. **If the player is holding a normal or closet door, the ghost cannot override it unless it detects the player as defined above. It can still leave an EMF signal and Ultraviolet (if applicable) if it cannot override the door. **Ghosts cannot randomly interact with small tent (hiding) doors but will do so if a player is detected in the small tent. *The ghost can blow out firelights within 5 meters during a hunt, though this is technically not a true interaction. Most other objects cannot be interacted with by the ghost during a hunt. ==Other hunt-related behaviour== During hunts, the ghost will always produce footsteps and one specific vocalization that is used for all hunts in that contract. The interval between footsteps depends on the moving speed of the ghost. Without adjusting for volume fall-off, the maximum distance a player can hear ghost footsteps and vocalizations during a hunt is 20 meters (12 meters for Myling). If the player(s) and the ghost are located on different floors during the hunt, there will be no electronic interference and the ghost's footsteps and vocalizations will be greatly muffled, though the range is still the same. Sound occlusion and electronic interference does not account for physics; a ghost going up a staircase may sound muffled and not cause electronic interference on the upper floor until it reaches the top, for example. Within 10 meters of the ghost (15 meters for Raiju), all active electronic equipment and map lights, as well as global chat, will malfunction and/or flicker rapidly. Players can hear their own heartbeat if the ghost is within 10 meters, and there are no walls, floors, or doors between the ghost and the player, and the closer the ghost is to the player, the louder the heartbeats. Most, if not all pieces of furniture do not prevent heartbeats even when the ghost technically does not have line-of-sight with the player. During a hunt, the ghost will flicker or flash in and out of existence. The first flicker-in occurs immediately when the grace period ends. The following shows the flickering rates of various ghosts: {| class=\"fandom-table\" !Ghost !Visibility length (s) !Invisibility length (s) !Total per-flicker length (s) !Average visibility compared to standard ghost |- |Standard |0.08 - 0.30 |0.10 - 0.92 |0.30 - 1.00 |N/A |- |Deogen* |0.20 - 0.30 |0.01? - 0.40 |0.30 - 0.60 |More visible/less invisible |- |Oni* |0.02? - 0.50 |0.01? - 0.50? |0.30? - 1.00? |More visible/less invisible |- |Phantom |0.08 - 0.30 |0.70 - 1.92 |1.00 - 2.00 |More invisible/less visible |}<small>*Note: values for Deogen and Oni are measured values and may not be accurate.</small><br>The total per-flicker length refers to the time between two consecutive flicker-ins, i.e. the total duration of 1 set of the ghost being visible and then invisible, in that order. The visibility length and invisibility length added together will not exceed the total per-flicker length. For example, if a normal ghost has a visibility length of 0.30 seconds in 1 set, the invisibility length in that same set will not exceed 0.70 seconds (the total not exceeding 1 second). In addition, the Obake occasionally shapeshifts into a different ghost model on one flicker-in, before returning to its normal model on the following flicker-in. Timed correctly, one can obtain Ghost photos during a hunt while the ghost flashes visible. The hunt also allows for Hunting Ghost videos and sounds to be obtained. ==Dying== For the ghost to kill a player, their \"collision boxes\" must intersect, and line-of-sight must be achieved. When the ghost kills a player, the player will drop all of their equipment and grotesque hands will appear on their screen before they are teleported into an otherworldly room alone with the ghost. The dead player will then return to their location with their entire screen covered in bright fog. From another player's perspective, the victim drops their equipment and reaches for their neck as they're being strangled by an invisible force, before dropping dead. One dead player chosen at random can be revived if a tarot card labeled The High Priestess is drawn or if the Monkey Paw's \"I wish for life\" wish is used with a 50% chance of killing the wishing player. If all players die, the contract will end. ==End of a hunt== A hunt ends when the ghost successfully kills a player (when Kills extend hunts is off), the ghost's hunting time is up, or there are no alive players within the investigation area for any reason, including if every player is killed, if every player glitches out at the start of a hunt/during a hunt, or if the exit doors are unlocked with the Monkey Paw's \"I wish to leave\" wish and every player exits during a hunt. When the hunt ends, the ghost will disappear and be teleported back to its ghost room, the exit door can be unlocked again, all on-site lights will turn off and can once again be toggled. ==Related difficulty settings== *Ghost speed (%): How quickly the ghost moves *Friendly ghost: The ghost will never hunt. Turning this setting on will result in zero rewards *Grace period (s): The duration before the ghost can kill you at the start of a hunt *Hunt duration (s): The duration the ghost will hunt for *Kills extend hunts (s): The time added to the hunt duration when killing a player *Setup time (s): How long before the ghost can start a hunt ==Trivia== *Hunts do not count toward witnessing a ghost event. *The number of hunts during a given game will appear on the resume screen in the lobby. *It is possible for a hunt to start without any players inside the investigation area; when a player stands perfectly in an exit doorway, it's possible for a hunt to start, as the game thinks they are inside the investigation area, but with the player getting pushed outwards and out of the investigation area when the doorway is blocked. If this happens, the hunt will immediately end. ==See also== *Guides/Surviving a hunt *Guides/Identifying ghosts *Guides/Common misconceptions ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access Alpha |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |2 February 2020 |Doubled the hunt duration. |- |Ghosts now have a higher chance of teleporting if it cannot find players while hunting. |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |5 March 2020 |Global chat is now unusable during hunts. |- |Ghosts will now flash in and out during hunts. |- !10 March 2020 |Ghosts will no longer teleport while hunting on smaller maps. |- ! 19 March 2020 |Added a grace period of 3 seconds to the start of the hunt. |- !23 March 2020<br>(Part 2) |Ghosts now flash at a faster rate during hunts. |- ! rowspan=\"3\" |23 March 2020<br>(Part 3) |Ghosts now appear for longer during hunts. |- |All exit doors are now locked during hunts and cannot be unlocked until after the hunt. |- |Ghosts now emit footstep sounds during hunts. |- ! 25 March 2020<br>(Part 2) |Hunts now cause the Site Activity Monitor to show at level 10. |- !30 March 2020 |Reduced the hunt duration. |- !31 March 2020 |Hunts will no longer initiate if no one is inside the building. |- !8 April 2020 |Added a 15 second cooldown between hunts. |- !26 April 2020 |Flashlights will now flicker during hunts. |- !30 July 2020<br>(Part 2) |Lights will now turn off while the ghost is in the room during a hunt. |- !15 August 2020<br>(Part 3) |The ghost is now invisible during the grace period at the start of a hunt. |- !17 August 2020<br>(Part 2) |Increased the cooldown between hunts to 25 seconds. |- !22 August 2020 |Heartbeats will now play when looking at the ghost while it is invisible during hunts. |- !3 September 2020<br>(Part 2) |The ghost now appears for longer when flashing during hunts. |- !10 September 2020 |Ghosts will now teleport back to the ghost room after a hunt. |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !22 September 2020 |Increased the grace period to 8 seconds. |- ! rowspan=\"6\" |0.28.6.5 |Decreased the grace period to 5 seconds. |- |Ghosts no longer move during the hunt's starting grace period. |- |Ghosts now accelerate or decelerate depending on whether they see a player. |- |Ghosts now have a chance to remember the last seen location of a player. |- |Ghosts now open both locker doors slightly as a chance or to kill players. |- |Furniture now blocks line-of-sight. |- ! rowspan=\"6\" | 0.3.0 |The flickering animation for flashlights during hunts has been changed. |- |All electronics now flicker during hunts, instead of only some. |- |Electronics now only flicker within a certain radius of the ghost. |- |Most electronics now attract the ghost during hunts. |- |Decreased the grace period to 3 seconds. |- |Global chat now works outside of the electronic interference range. |- !0.3.0.1 |Increased the grace period to 4 seconds. |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |0.4.0 |The hunt duration is now variable based on map size. |- |The grace period is now variable based on difficulty. |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |0.5.0 |Ghosts can now throw objects during hunts. |- |Added cursed hunts. |- !0.6.1.0 |Ghosts can now check behind doors. |- !0.6.2.1 |Ghosts no longer emit footsteps while standing still during the grace period. |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |0.7.0 |Reduced the audible range of ghost vocalisations from unlimited to 20 metres. |- |Increased the rate of interacting with objects during hunts to 50% every 0.5 seconds. |} ==References== ==Notes== ru:Охота fr:Chasse<!-- zh:猎杀--> Category:Ghost State","title":"Hunt","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Hunt"}
{"content":"Incense is a purchasable item that can be used to temporarily deter the ghost from hunting or blind the ghost during a hunt when ignited. ==Usage== To light incense, have an igniter in the inventory, hold the incense, then press the key. Incense thrown on the ground can also be lit by aiming at it while holding an igniter or firelight, then pressing . Once lit, the incense will emit smoke for a certain amount of time depending on the tier level: *Tier I: 5 seconds *Tier II: 6 seconds *Tier III: 7 seconds While burning, the incense attempts multiple times per second to successfully apply its effect(s), but can only apply the effect(s) once. When the incense is used up, the smoke will stop being emitted and the model will finish burning to a stub. There is no explicit indication of whether the incense was used effectively or not. Used incense can still be handheld, but since there's nothing to use, it is normally discarded. ===Effects=== The incense has a range in which the ghost must be for its effects to be successfully applied. This range depends on the tier level: *Tier I: 3 metres *Tier II: 4 metres *Tier III: 5 metres ====Regular \"cleansing\"==== When the ghost is within the incense's range while it is burning, the following will occur: *Ghost activity will be increased marginally *The ghost will be unable to initiate a hunt on its own for a certain duration: **Demon: 60 seconds **Spirit: 180 seconds **All other ghosts: 90 seconds *If the ghost is a Gallu, it will switch to its \"enraged\" state if it was in a \"normal\" state, or to its \"normal\" state if it was in a \"weakened\" state. *If the ghost is a Yurei, it will also return to its favorite room and cannot roam out for 90 seconds. This will not prevent ghost events from happening outside the room. Lighting incense will not prevent cursed hunts nor stop an already ongoing hunt, but doing this during a hunt will prevent further attempts to initiate regular hunts for the specified duration starting from when the incense effect is applied. If another incense is used while this effect from a previous incense is ongoing, this effect <u>will not</u> be re-applied and the timer <u>will not</u> be reset. Due to a quirk in how incense works, ghosts which are standing on stairs will not be affected by the \"cleansing\" property of incense, though they will be affected by the \"blinding\" ability described below. ====Blinding during hunts==== <div class=\"mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"width: 200px; float: right;\"> <span style=\"color:#ffcd36; font-size:80%\">This image has flashing lights.</span> <div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\"></div> </div> Incense can be used to \"blind\" the ghost during a hunt. For this effect to apply, the ghost must be within the incense's range. When the effect is successfully applied, the ghost will: *Be forced into its \"wandering phase\", walking in a random direction *Be unable to detect or kill players; one can walk through it without dying *Temporarily lose its accumulated speed from line-of-sight *The Tier II incense additionally slows the ghost down to 50% of its speed. *The Tier III incense additionally stops the ghost from moving entirely. This effect lasts for 5 seconds for most ghosts, 4 seconds for an enraged Gallu, 6 seconds for a weakened Gallu, and 7.5 seconds for a Moroi. After this period, the ghost will return to its regular hunting behaviour, and be able to see and kill players again. Multiple incenses can be used for the same purpose during the same hunt with no diminishing returns, to blind the ghost for up to 20 seconds (30 for a Moroi) consecutively. If another incense is used while this effect from a previous incense is ongoing, this effect will be re-applied and the timer will be reset. ==Tips== *When lighting incense near a ghost during a hunt, the ghost may coincidentally take the same path as a player, especially in tight hallways. It does not mean that the ghost can still see the player. If possible, light the incense near (but not in) a hiding spot, so that you can reach it before the ghost is no longer blind. *If you are not the host, and especially if there is some latency between you and the server, the game may register the ghost killing the player before the incense effect actually applies. To avoid this, try lighting the incense earlier. *In some scenarios, it may be beneficial to use a lower-tier incense, for example if the ghost detects a player in a hiding spot and corners them, and an incense is used to protect the player; using a Tier III incense will freeze the ghost in place, possibly in a location where they can still see the player in the hiding spot and force them to switch to another hiding spot, while a Tier I or Tier II incense will cause the ghost to move away and allow the player to stay in said hiding spot. Using a lower-tier incense is also beneficial if the ghost is significantly faster than the player e.g. against a naturally fast ghost such as a young Thaye, or in custom difficulties where the ghost is faster and/or the player is slower; a Tier I incense will allow the ghost to stay relatively fast while blind, potentially moving the ghost much further away and putting a much larger distance between the player and the ghost compared to a Tier II or Tier III incense. ==Gallery== <gallery> Smudge sticks.png|Pre-Exposition model being held in the player's hand. </gallery> ==Objectives== {| class=\"article-table\" !Objective !Actual requirements |- |Cleanse the area near the ghost using Incense |Light Incense within range of the ghost |- |Repel the Ghost with Incense while it's chasing someone |Smudge a hunting ghost while it has line-of-sight with a player, making it wander |} ==Trivia== *Before 0.9.0, Incense was referred to as \"Smudge Sticks\". Despite being referred to as \"smudging\", the smudge sticks are used more akin to \"smoke cleansing\". Smudging is a spiritual and religious practice found in various Native American cultures, many of which use white sage, a plant native to North America. Smudging is typically used for personal spiritual cleansing, prayer, and ceremonial occasions, the technique varying from tribe to tribe. Smoke cleansing, on the other hand, is used predominantly to ward off negative energy and evil spirits, and is used by wafting the smoke of sage or herbs around an area, sometimes accompanied by prayer, chanting, or incantations. Smoke cleansing is a practice commonly found in modern-day Wicca and witchcraft. *The original description for this item was as follows: \"This has always been one of the main ways to weaken the more common ghosts.

{"content":"Ghost Writing is a piece of evidence used to determine which ghost is haunting a location.

{"content":"|265x265px]] Hiding Spots are features within a Map that allow players to survive hunts. ==Mechanics== ===Availability=== The number of available hiding spots depends on the difficulty as well as the number of players: *Amateur: All spots available *Intermediate: At least 3 spots available *Professional: At least 2 spots available *Nightmare/Insanity: At least 1 spot available *3 players: +1 spot available *4 players: +2 spots available For example, a Professional game with 3 players will have at least 3 hiding spots available throughout the entire map. By using a custom difficulty, hiding spots can also be turned off entirely, overriding all other rules. When a spot is unavailable, it can be blocked off with \"junk\"/storage equipment, be sealed behind a locked door, or have its concealing elements removed. The unavailable spots are randomly chosen at the beginning of each investigation. ===List of hiding spots=== A full list of hiding spots is available on each map's own page. See Map § List of maps. ==Tips== ]] * The ghost cannot open a closet/locker door that is currently being held by a player; Ideally, using this method, the ghost can only open one of the closet doors. Both doors can be held, in multiplayer. ** When hiding in a closet with one door fully open, you must hug the door you are holding to have better chances at survival. ** However, if the ghost detected the player inside or near a closet/locker, the ghost will forcibly open the doors, overriding the player holding the door shut. * Players are not forced to use \"official\" hiding spots. Some players may improvise and use furniture such as kitchen tables/islands to hide. As a general rule of thumb, if an object covers the player to at least their eye level, it can (but may not) work as a viable hiding spot.

{"content":".]] Keys are used to unlock exit doors to investigation areas within maps, or to turn off a car alarm. ==Usage== At the start of every investigation, the location's Main Door Key will be hung on the hook beside the door keypad in the truck. A player needs to collect it in order to unlock the exit doors and enter the location. If the map has a car, a car key can also be found within the map; using a car key on the car will cause it to beep twice and turn off the alarm if it was previously on. Keys are shared across all players and can be used at any time, except during hunts where all exit doors will be locked. Keys that have been collected in the contract will show up in the journal. ===Types of keys=== * Main Door Key: Found in the truck, the Main Door Key is used to unlock the main door or side doors of a building. * Car Key: Found in 6 Tanglewood Drive, 13 Willow Street, 42 Edgefield Road, and 10 Ridgeview Court. Can be used to turn off car alarms set off by the ghost. *Cabin Key: Found in Maple Lodge Campsite, under the rug near the cabin door. Used to unlock the door to the Cabin. *Lantern Cabinet Key: Found in Point Hope, at the pool ball exit after solving a certain riddle at the pool. Can be used to unlock the lantern cabinet in Lantern Room. ==Trivia== *In earlier updates, Garage Keys and Basement Keys were formerly present on certain small maps, intended to unlock the doors to their respective rooms.

{"content":"Grafton Farmhouse is a small map in Phasmophobia, and one of the two variants of the Farmhouse, alongside Bleasdale Farmhouse. This isolated, half-ruined three-story farmhouse has a spacious ground floor, a smaller second floor, and an attic. ==Structure== Grafton Farmhouse includes 3 bedrooms, a dining room, a library, an attic, and a workshop, among other rooms. ===Layout tips=== *On the second floor, to the left of the door to the Master Bathroom, there is a door seemingly leading to another spacious room; however, it is jammed. *The Foyer's main light is shattered and provides intermittent illumination; consider turning on the lantern on some boxes near the stairs for much better visibility. *The fuse box only warms up Downstairs Bathroom, Work Room, Master Bedroom, Master Bathroom, and Child Bedroom.

{"content":"This guide will teach you how to earn more money in Phasmophobia, mainly focusing on maximizing the value of photo rewards. == Photo rewards == Photo rewards can be obtained by taking photos of various objects or appearances using a Photo Camera. The overall reward will vary based on the number of photos taken, and the type and quality of these photos. For the purpose of this guide only, the photos shall be separated into 3 \"groups\": * Group A (high reward): Ghost (including in D.O.T.S.) * Group B (medium reward): Bone, Burned Crucifix, Dirty Water * Group C (low reward): Cursed possession, Dead Body, Disturbed Salt, Fingerprint, Footprint, Ghost Writing, Interaction The rewards from these groups are as follows: {| class=\"article-table sortable mw-collapsible\" |+Photo rewards summary ! Group ! 1 star ! 2 stars ! 3 stars |- | A | $5<br>5 XP | $10<br>10 XP | $20<br>20 XP |- | B | $2<br>2 XP | $5<br>5 XP | $10<br>10 XP |- | C | $1<br>1 XP | $2<br>2 XP | $5<br>5 XP |} The absolute maximum payout obtainable is $110/110 XP, but this is generally hindered by the lack of objects required to obtain this reward. Additionally, the reward cannot be multiplied higher than x1. Realistically, one can expect a maximum of $85 - $90 on most contracts. The following are a few examples of the photo rewards players could obtain (there are many more combinations): * 1 Ghost + 1 Bone + 4 Burned Crucifix + 4 Dirty Water (maximum of $110/110 XP) * 1 Ghost + 1 Bone + 4 Burned Crucifix + 1 Dirty Water + 3 Group C photos ($95/95 XP) * 1 Ghost + 1 Bone + 1 - 4 Burned Crucifix + 4 - 7 Group C photos ($75/75 XP - $90/90 XP) * 1 Bone + 1 - 4 Burned Crucifix + 5 - 8 Group C Photos ($60/60 XP - $75/75 XP) In case of a wasted photo shot or one that is below 3 stars, up to two photos can be deleted from the journal. Three-star photos cannot be deleted. Deleting photos is best used as a margin of error for getting a perfect investigation bonus, and not for min-maxing photo rewards. === Ghost === Ghost photos are worth the most, giving you $20 and 20 XP. However, only the first ghost photo will count; subsequent photos are blank. In the unlikely case that multiple players manage to take one at the same time, they will all count and provide rewards, though this is likely a bug. * Using the Summoning Circle, Music Box, or Monkey Paw is preferred over ghost events, and ghost events are preferred over taking the picture during a hunt. ** Singing ghost events last for the longest duration, and the ghost stands in place; this is preferred over other types of events. * In ghost events, ghosts disappear if the \"event target\" collides with it, so make sure that this player (or all players, if it is unclear which person is being targeted) maintains a safe distance from the ghost before the picture is taken. ** Ghost events almost always start in the same room as where the event target was. * During hunts, there is no clear strategy other than attempting to time the flickering and snapping at the right time, and is ultimately down to intuition, reflexes, and a bit of luck. **Taking a photo during a hunt should be seen as a last resort if no alternatives are available, as it is easy to not only miss the shot wholesale, but also to take it from too far away to not be ranked at 3 stars, and ruin the chance for the perfect game bonus, and there's also an inherent risk involved in exposing yourself during a hunt to try and take a photo, which will almost certainly put you in the ghost's line-of-sight and attract its attention. * Taking photos during a hunt is even harder with the Phantom, but easier with the Deogen and Oni. * If the ghost has D.O.T.S. Projector as evidence, taking a picture of the ghost's D.O.T.S. silhouette will also count as a full ghost photo. This should be the preferred way to get the ghost photo if using Tier II or III D.O.T.S. Projectors. === Bone === * On larger maps, finding the bone should be treated as a side task after all other objectives have been completed, due to the sheer amount of space that needs to be checked to find it. If the Ouija Board is available, you can use it to locate the bone. === Cursed possession === * The middle of the summoning circle must be within the frame to be registered as a valid photo; crouch and aim for the centre of the circle. === Fingerprint === * A photo of a fingerprint can only be obtained after a UV Light has charged it. If the EMF reading is still active, taking a photo of the same surface will yield an Interaction photo that can also help in filling the journal. * Each surface can only \"store\" one fingerprint at a time - if the ghost touches the door three times, you can only get the most recent fingerprint in photo. * Each fingerprint can only be taken in photo once. Ensure that none of your teammates have already taken a photo of the fingerprint. === Footprint === * Footprints are easy to get provided the ghost can generate them and walks around. If footprints are placed on top of each other due to the ghost stepping on the same spot, listening to the heavy footstep sounds and counting the steps may help the player know how many valid pictures can be taken of that spot. ** A ghost may enter its idling phase after stepping on salt and can potentially leave no or few footprints. Listen for the ghost's footsteps to tell if it is moving and hence creating footprints. * If you are using a tier II UV Light, only activate it after the ghost has stepped in the salt and you are ready to take photos. This will ensure that the glowstick is shining brightly when you need it. A secondary measure is to right click while the glowstick is in hand to \"re-invigorate\" it to get more light. === Disturbed salt === * When disturbed, the salt pile itself counts as a \"Disturbed Salt\" photo, which can be obtained even if the ghost does not have Ultraviolet evidence. * If the player is simply trying to fill up the journal with 3-star photos to obtain a Perfect Investigation bonus and don't care as much about the value of photo rewards themselves, piling up a large amount of salt piles on a chokepoint is an extremely easy way to fill up the journal with 3-star photos; when the ghost walks through the chokepoint, all of the salt piles will be disturbed at once, allowing for 6 Disturbed Salt photos with Tier I Salt, or 9 photos with Tier II or III Salt. === Interaction === * The Ouija Board, if available, is a valuable source of interaction pictures. Each successful question answered by the ghost counts as an individual interaction photo, and the use of low-cost questions can be used to quickly fill up the journal without having to wait for the ghost to perform multiple interactions. * The Voodoo Doll causes the ghost to create an interaction, and thus a new photo opportunity, with each use, but also risks starting a cursed hunt. Stay some distance away from the ghost (room) before pushing pins. * Saying recognized phrases will increase the chance of the ghost interacting with something, though there is a cooldown on this and the player has to be near the ghost. * Shades cannot use or throw items while the player is in the room. Try standing just outside the room if you intend to obtain interaction photos. * Wraiths leave no fingerprints and do not step in salt at all, making it much more difficult to fill a journal. Try placing multiple props in and around the ghost room to get interaction photos. === Burned crucifix === * Each photo of a burned crucifix is worth twice an interaction, and may warrant the extra risk. Place crucifixes spaced apart in/near the favourite room (or nearby, depending on the room's size). * The crucifix's overall effectiveness is hampered in larger rooms, as there is more area for the ghost to walk and find a spot that both crucifixes miss, or fully consume one crucifix while walking to places that the other one doesn't cover and hunts from there. Regardless of how large the room is, the ghost can simply begin a hunt while wandering away from the favourite room at an area where crucifixes have not been set up. * If the ghost can teleport or walk to a player (e.g. Wraith, Banshee, Phantom), it may be wise to stay on top of the crucifix to ensure that the ghost using its ability does not cause it to move away from the crucifixes, keeping in mind if a hiding spot can be reached with enough ease if the ghost manages to avoid the crucifix regardless and hunts. * Taking a second picture of a crucifix while the EMF reading from the successful hunt prevention is active provides an additional interaction photo. * Two photos can be taken of a Tier II and Tier III crucifix, one on each use; this can net the player a maximum of 4 burned crucifix photos per contract. * As a last resort if the ghost refuses to hunt, if the player has an unused Tier III crucifix, a cursed possession can be used to force a hunt to begin to immediately consume the Tier III crucifix for photos. === Dirty water === * As dirty water is highly dependent on having the ghost linger in rooms with sinks, it is generally not worth waiting around for the ghost to produce it, though you should always take a picture of dirty water if it occurs. * Dirty water can only be obtained once per sink, even if the ghost interacts with it several times. * As with the burned crucifix, taking a second photo of a sink while the EMF reading is still active will provide an additional interaction photo. ** Further interactions with a sink with dirty water by the ghost will continue to provide interaction photos. === General tips === * For all subjects, you need to take a picture of its centre. If the centre is not within frame, the photo will not count. For the ghost, this rule is less strict. * Each individual dead body, disturbed salt, or footprint can be photographed by multiple players. In a 4-player game, just 3 instances of disturbed salt are technically enough to fill up the whole journal. * Where needed, crouch to reduce the distance between you and the photo subject, allowing a 3-star photo to be taken. * It may sometimes be more worth it to move on to a new investigation, instead of waiting around for the last few photos to take. == Custom difficulties == <blockquote><small>This section needs expansion. (February 2024)</small></blockquote> Depending on your skill level, you can create a custom difficulty with increased multipliers over Insanity that will allow you to earn more money per unit time than you normally would on a standard difficulty. If the player is skilled enough and has good knowledge of ghosts, a common strategy is to turn off all evidence, which grants a large bonus, and attempt to identify the ghost through behaviour. Although photo rewards are practically pocket change in comparison to objective rewards at very high multipliers, filling up the journal with three-star photos is still required for obtaining a perfect investigation bonus, even if the photos themselves are relatively not as worthwhile. * When playing before level 16 is reached, setting \"Sanity Medication restoration amount\" to 0% is completely free, as Sanity Medication is not unlocked until then. == Investigation bonuses == * Investigation bonus: Identify the ghost correctly and escape alive. This will double all rewards from ghost identification and all completed objectives, which is then further multiplied by the difficulty multiplier. * Perfect investigation bonus: In addition to the above, fill your journal with 10 3-star photos of any category, collect the bone, and complete all objectives. Besides rewards from completing these items, an additional bonus of $50 and 50 XP will be rewarded, which is affected by the difficulty multiplier. == Other rewards and tips == * Avoiding death is possibly the easiest way to earn money, and avoid losing it. * While it may be tempting to be stingy and minimize the use of consumable items, the overall low price of them will be drastically overshadowed by the reward from objectives successfully completed by electing to use them when they're needed. * Daily and Weekly Tasks are available for the player to earn extra money. Some of these are easy, like buying an item, but some may require more proactiveness, like taking a ghost photo, and some can be extremely difficult, such as the \"Earn Perfect Investigation Bonuses on Nightmare or harder\" weekly task. * Concerning weekly tasks, completing the Challenge Mode weekly task is one of the most time-efficient ways to earn money, potentially netting the player $5000 in three games, meaning the player effectively gets an extra ~$1667 per game in addition to the rewards given by each game themselves; however, the difficulty of challenges themselves can vary greatly, ranging from very easy ones such as Speedrun! to extremely difficult ones such as The Apocalypse Draws Near. * \"Get a ghost to blow out a Firelight\" can be completed via the static candles or the campfires that appear on some maps if you light those and the ghost blows them out, which saves a consumable.

{"content":"The Mare is a type of ghost in Phasmophobia. The Mare has a distaste for light and will be enhanced in the dark. ==Behaviour== ===Activity=== Mares cannot interact with lights to turn them on, and they are more likely to choose turning off lights as an interaction. They also cannot perform the light flickering interaction (the one that specifically leaves an EMF reading at a light switch as opposed to the \"atmospheric\" light flickering). The Mare does not have any affinity with computer monitors, televisions, Bleasdale Farmhouse's motion activated lights, and the fuse box, and can turn them on or off like most other ghosts. The Mare also does not have any affinity with fire sources and can still light them up. The Mare has a higher chance of performing light-shattering ghost events over other types, as this will disable the lights, making it easier to hunt. When the lights are on in its current room, the Mare is more likely to perform long roams. Contrary to most other ghosts, the Mare is able to perform long roams while its current room is not the favourite room. ===Ability=== If a player turns on a light (excluding TVs and computers) that is within 4 metres of a Mare, it has a 1/7 chance of turning the light off almost instantly, with a maximum delay of 1 second. Each light has a cooldown per player of 10 seconds after it has been turned on or off, and the Mare cannot perform its ability on a light that has an active cooldown. The Mare can use this ability even if the fuse box is turned off or broken, but not if the light is shattered. The ability also works during a ghost event. ===Hunt=== A Mare has a modified hunt sanity threshold depending on whether the room it is currently in is lit. If the lights are turned off, the hunt sanity threshold is increased to 60%, and if the lights are turned on, the threshold is decreased to 40%. This applies even if the fuse box is turned off or broken, but not if the room's lights are destroyed. Other sources of light, such as brought-in equipment and Firelights, do not affect this threshold. ==Evidence== ==Strengths and weaknesses== These are the strengths and weaknesses as listed in the journal: Strength: A Mare will have an increased chance to attack in the dark. Weakness: Turning the lights on around the Mare will lower its chance to attack. ==Strategies== Players should be cautious when using the Spirit Box or looking for Ghost Orbs to verify the ghost's current location or favourite room, as the Mare is more likely to hunt when the lights in its room are off, potentially catching players dangerously close to the Mare when it begins to hunt. Once a Mare is identified, there are two ways to counteract it: *Leave the lights in its favourite room and neighbouring rooms turned on. This will lower its hunt sanity threshold. *Once the sanity threshold is below 40%, the Mare will be able to hunt regardless of whether the lights are on or not. Hence, it may be wise to leave the lights in its favourite room turned off. This way, the Mare is less likely to wander away, and will be more likely to hunt in that room, making it less dangerous than a case where the Mare is constantly roaming into other rooms (and possibly changing its favourite room). In both cases, keeping a player near the light switches can help to counteract the Mare's ability if they are turned off by the ghost or from an electrical overload. Whether the lights are turned on or off do not affect the Mare's chance of performing a light-shattering ghost event. Where possible, avoid staying in rooms where you want the lights turned on, so that the Mare is less likely to shatter them. ===Identification=== The Mare is generally one of the more difficult ghosts to identify based on behaviour, though one can look for the following: *The ability to turn a light back off the moment a player turns it on: try to pause a few seconds between turning the lights on. **When the ghost manifests itself during a ghost event, try turning nearby lights on. As ghosts can't normally interact with lights during manifestation ghost events, if a light is turned off during one (and not at the beginning or at the end), it definitively confirms the Mare's ability being used. *A preference for light-shattering ghost events. *A ghost that hunts slightly earlier in the dark or slightly later in the light, though this is not very reliable. *If you tend to keep the lights near the ghost turned on, and you find the ghost frequently wandering into rooms that players have not entered, and changing favourite rooms frequently on Professional difficulty or higher, then the ghost could be a Mare. A ghost turning on the light directly eliminates the possibility of it being a Mare. On the other hand, any ghost may choose to never turn on a light throughout the entire game, so this negative should not be used to confirm the ghost type. In fact, any ghost may turn off a light immediately after you turn it on purely by chance. Additionally, some ghost events turn the lights off at their beginning or at their end; this does not count as a Mare's ability. When seeing lights flickering outside of ghost events and hunts, if an EMF reading happens to be created at a light switch, it is not a Mare. ==Trivia== *In 0.3.1.0's Journal overhaul, the Mare's description was incorrectly changed to an old version where Mares caused hallucinations that dropped a person's sanity, which could be stopped by toggling one's flashlight. This feature was replaced with the current light-based hunt sanity threshold before early access release. Hallucinations that are not tied to one ghost will be added in a future update as part of the \"Horror 2.0\" overhaul. *The Mare is based on the Scandinavian and Germanic mythological creature \"Mara\". The Mare in mythology was not technically a spirit but rather a normal woman that transformed at night due to a curse applied by circumstances of her birth. This curse applied to a man would instead create a Werewolf. The Mara would enter peoples homes at night and then place themself on their victims chest, making them paralyzed and giving them a feeling of suffocation. She was also responsible for nightmares and gave name to that phenomenon; Nightmare in English and Mardröm in Swedish. She also had a tendency to attack livestock making them exhausted and sickly. A sign that a Mare was active was that humans and animals attacked by her tended to get strange tangles and knots in their hair or fur. To drive off a Mare, one had to find its \"mare tree\" which was a specific tree the Mare had bound itself to, and could be identified by its tangled twigs (in reality, this is a phenomenon called \"Witch's broom\", and is caused by phytoplasmas). A twig from that tree, placed in the bed of the sufferer, would drive away the Mare. The Mare is usually depicted as a pale, gaunt woman with claw-like hands, long tangled hair and pale orb-like eyes. This of course does not apply to Phasmophobia; the ghost may take any appearance, including being male. ==History== {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access Alpha |- !18 March 2020 |Spirit Box is now required as one of the evidences instead of EMF 5. |- !7 August 2020 |Looking at a Mare will now lower sanity and at a rate slightly faster than other ghosts. |- !17 August 2020 |Changed the Mare's ability from causing hallucinations to being able to hunt in the dark at higher sanity levels and in light at lower sanity levels. |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !0.2.11.0 |Mares can no longer turn lights on. |- !0.3.0 |Prior to 0.3.0, the evidence was Spirit Box, Ghost Orb, and Freezing Temperatures. |- !0.3.1.0 |An incorrect description of the Mare describing its old ability was added.

{"content":"The UV light is a buyable starter item used to detect Ultraviolet evidence such as fingerprints and footprints. ==Usage== The UV light can be enabled using the key while holding it. The UV light can be activated at the same time as a standard flashlight, but any visible fingerprints or footprints may contrast poorly and be hard to see under their light. The UV light projects purple light and this light is weak relative to flashlights. The Tier I and III UV Lights will not work if Flashlights are turned off in custom difficulty settings. Ghosts that give ultraviolet evidence can leave prints on certain surfaces doors, light switches, and windows. They may also leave prints on floors after stepping through salt. These prints become visible and green when a UV light is shone towards them. The Tier I UV Light is a flashlight with a narrow spotlight. It counts as an electronic equipment. So it will flicker rapidly near a manifesting ghost and will attract the ghost during a hunt when it is nearby. Tier II UV Light is a small glowstick. When activated, it glows brightly for 1 minute, then fades to half intensity over the next 10 seconds. After dimming, the glowstick can be shaken with to revitalize the light it produces. The tier III UV Light is also a flashlight. However, it has a much wider spotlight and a lesser charge time than tier I. It also counts as an electronic equipment. ==Tips== *As of patch 0.9.0, UV prints must be illuminated by a UV light to take a successful photo. *Many regard the Tier II UV Light as superior to the Tier I and III versions, due to the fact that the player can simply throw the glowstick on the floor and it will continuously illuminate any prints nearby, and it is also not an electronic, allowing the player to use it as a light source during hunts without the ghost detecting it. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access Alpha |- !28 August 2020<br>(Part 3) |Added glowsticks. |- ! colspan=\"2\" | Early Access |- ! rowspan=\"3\" |0.3.0 |Changed the glowstick model. |- |The glowstick now fades after a short while. |- |Changed the UV flashlight model. |- !0.3.0.1 |The glowstick now fades to half intensity over 10 seconds after 1 minute. |- ! rowspan=\"3\" |0.9.0 |UV light now has 3 tiers. |- |The glowstick has been repurposed as the Tier 1 UV light. |- |After it dims, the glowstick can now be shaken to revitalize the light it produces. |- !0.10.0 |Swapped tier I and tier II UV Light. |} Category:Equipment Category:Starter Equipment fr:Lampe UV ru:Ультрафиолетовый свет","title":"UV Light","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/UV_Light"}
{"content":"In Phasmophobia, players can visit several maps to execute a contract. Each investigation area is accessible after collecting and using the Main Door Key. Maps will come with a randomized weather type. ==List of maps== Phasmophobia currently has a total of 14 maps, comprising 7 small maps, 5 medium maps and 2 large maps. ===Small=== *6 Tanglewood Drive *42 Edgefield Road *10 Ridgeview Court *Nell's Diner *Grafton Farmhouse *13 Willow Street *Camp Woodwind ===Medium=== *Point Hope *Bleasdale Farmhouse *Sunny Meadows Restricted *Prison *Maple Lodge Campsite ===Large=== *Brownstone High School *Sunny Meadows ===Removed Maps=== *Asylum ==Effects== The map type affects money and experience gain, sanity drain, and light limits. Most maps require the player to reach a certain level to unlock them. One can play on a map they have yet to unlock by joining the lobby of another player that has unlocked that map. ===Light limits=== Each map has a maximum number of lights that can be turned on. This depends on map size: *Small maps: 9 *Medium maps: 8 *Large maps: 7 If the limit is exceeded, the fuse box will instantly trip (turn off), as well as all light switches and lamps. This refers to the number of interactable light switches and lamps on the map, and not the physical number of light bulbs or tubes. ==Segmentation== All maps are divided into \"inside\" (investigation area) and \"outside\" areas. The investigation area is further split into rooms, among which one will be the ghost room. ===Investigation area=== The investigation area (officially, the location) is bounded by physical barriers and one or more exits for all maps. The ghost can only be present within the investigation area; the ghost cannot exit or spawn outside the investigation area. Some maps also contain outdoor areas where the ghost may be present: *Maple Lodge Campsite and Camp Woodwind: Outdoor camping area (limited by the wooden gates) *Sunny Meadows Mental Institution/Restricted: Square courtyard *Point Hope: Balcony *Bleasdale Farmhouse: Garden Porch, Garden, Side Path For all other maps, only indoor areas are considered part of the investigation area; this includes hallways and corridors. ===Rooms=== Each map has a fixed number of rooms. Mechanics-wise, rooms may be segmented differently for the ghost than what is visually perceived by players. Rooms separated by walls may be merged to be considered as one room, while rooms that are not separated by walls may actually be regarded as multiple rooms. The Ouija Board's answers to the ghost's current location, as well as the location of Ghost Orbs, depend on each room's defined boundaries. ====Rooms not separated by visible walls==== Some rooms that seem like a single room are broken down into multiple rooms with no apparent visual barrier. For example: *The hallways on each level of Brownstone High School are divided into three separate sections: the left, front, and right. *In 10 Ridgeview Court, upon first entering the house, what appears to be one room actually consists of three different rooms: The Foyer, Dining Room, and Living Room. *In Maple Lodge Campsite, the outdoor paths and tenting areas are split up into several \"rooms\" not including the tents themselves. ====Rooms composed of multiple walled rooms==== Some rooms actually consist of two or more visually-distinct, walled rooms connected by doorways. For example: *Nearly all smaller bathrooms or storage rooms that are attached to a larger bedroom are considered as part of the same room as the bathroom. *In 42 Edgefield Road, the \"Basement\" room consists of both the hallway and the attached storage room. *In Brownstone High School, each Science Class Room (i.e., Science Class Room 1, 2, 3, and 4) is a room that consists of two rooms separated by a wall and a door. *On the Prison's second floor, the Infirmary as a room actually consists of two rooms that contain medical beds. In any room that consists of two or more walled rooms, Ghost Orbs may appear in any of the walled rooms, and the ghost can spawn for hunts in any of these rooms. This is essential to know, for example, to complete the crucifix objective. ===Ghost room=== The ghost room is akin to the ghost's \"base\"; it will usually spawn in that room, and most ghosts will generally linger in or near this room, subject to randomness and ghost abilities. ==References== Category:Maps fr:Carte ru:Карты","title":"Map","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Map"}
{"content":"An interaction is a core mechanic in Phasmophobia. It is an occurrence of the Ghost affecting its environment and items within it, and is one of the key parts of ghost activity. Although not evidence in and of itself, it both helps players to find certain pieces of evidence, and allows them to gather rewards by recording it. Ghost events and hunts do not count as interactions, but the ghost can still interact with the environment during both. ==Mechanics== Ghosts can interact with a variety of items, including handheld objects, doors, windows, electronics, and switches, among other things. Each interaction causes an EMF 2 reading, or an EMF 3 reading in the case of a thrown object, emitted at the point of interaction for 20 seconds. If an object levitates, there is an additional EMF 3 that only lasts for the duration of levitation. If the ghost has EMF Level 5 as one of its types of evidence, each individual reading has a 33% chance to be EMF 5 instead. When touching surfaces or switches, the relevant ghosts may also leave fingerprints on them. Most ghosts can interact with items located within a box centered on them. This box can rotate, making the effective range a cylinder limited by floors. The effective range is ~2.12 meters on small and medium maps (3m × 3m × 2m box), and ~4.24 meters on large maps (6m × 6m × 4m box). Ghosts can interact with objects through walls. Props (not fixed objects such as doors) are thrown with a \"power\" of 1 - 3 horizontally, 1 - 5 vertically, and in one of four ways: *40% chance of direct throw. *35% chance of levitation then throw. *20% chance of levitation then drop. *5% chance of levitation then throw at player. These chances also apply to the Poltergeist's ability. During hunts, ghosts have a 50% chance of throwing an object (if one is nearby) every 0.5 seconds. Ghosts can also interact with doors during hunts, 3 seconds after the beginning of the hunt, then every 4 - 8 seconds. The chance of an interaction can be increased through the following: *Playing on a lower difficulty *Customizing the ghost's interaction rate on the Custom difficulty settings *Cleansing the area near the ghost with Incense *Saying phrases that are recognised by the game, such as its name or questions **This has a cooldown of 10 seconds, and the player must have spent 2 seconds near the ghost *Having a Lower sanity *Using certain cursed possessions ===Ghost-specific modifiers=== Some ghosts have different interaction rates or mechanics: *Mares are more likely to choose turning off lights as an interaction *Oni are more likely to interact with objects if people are nearby *Poltergeists are more likely to throw objects, have a throwing power of 2 - 6 horizontally and of 3 - 6 vertically, can throw multiple objects at the same time, and have a 100% chance every 0.5 seconds of throwing nearby objects during hunts, instead of 50% *Shades perform interactions less often and cannot perform interactions if a player is in the same room *Thaye are initially twice as more likely to interact with objects; this decreases over time to a minimum of twice as less likely to interact as they age *When The Twins uses its ability, it can interact within two ranges; one within the normal range, and the other up to ~8.48m on small and medium maps (6m × 6m box) or ~16.97m on large maps (12m × 12m box) *Yokai are more active if people are talking nearby Interactions can be forced by using a Voodoo Doll. Ghosts cannot throw items if the lights in their current room are on, except for when the Poltergeist uses its multithrow ability. ===Rewards=== Most interactions can be filmed with a Video Camera to get rewards. Additionally, a Photo Camera can be used to take a photo of a levitating object. ===Types of interactions=== This is a (non-exhaustive) list of interactions that the ghost can perform: *Phone (wall-mounted, rotary dial-type or smartphone) ringing *A radio (not the Spirit Box) turning on or off *The Ouija Board's planchette moving after a successful question *Ghost Writing action *Fuse Box turning on or off *A musical instrument being played *A rocking chair rocking by itself *A grandfather clock chiming *A painting falling off the wall *Items being thrown *A teddy bear having its head twisted or giggling *A bear trap (only on Maple Lodge Campsite) *Car alarm being set off *A television turning on or off *Computer monitors turning on or off *Lights being turned on or off *Lights flickering *A shower being turned on or off *Fire sources being lit up or blown out *Doors being moved *Window/mirror knocks *A mannequin moving (either rotating or teleporting) ==Tips== *Common interactions in one room at the early stages of investigation can pinpoint to it being the ghost room, or at least near where the ghost is. *The overall number of interactions of a given game can be seen on the corkboard at the end of the mission. ==Related difficulty settings== *Activity level: Low/Medium/High ==References== ==Notes== Category:Gameplay fr:Interaction ru:Взаимодействие","title":"Interaction","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Interaction"}
{"content":"Brownstone High School is a map in Phasmophobia. It was the first medium-sized map added to the game, though it is now a large-sized map. Its square shape and general symmetry can make it difficult to navigate, and its long hallways may make perpetual running almost impossible. ==Structure== Brownstone High School has one front and one side yard (separated from each other), about three dozen classrooms, eight bathrooms, a lecture hall, a cafeteria, and a gymnasium complete with two locker rooms. The entire building is approximately 85 by 55 meters. Brownstone High School features five exit doors. Due to the large distance between the closest entrance and the truck, it may be desirable to stage gear close to the building before entering. The rear exit doors lead onto a outdoor yard featuring an exterior basketball court. It is considered a safe zone, therefore preventing passive sanity drain. ===Layout tips=== *All hallways on both floors cannot be chosen as a favourite room, meaning Ghost Orbs do not need to be checked for in these hallways. The Lobby can be chosen as a favourite room, however. *The four Science Classrooms at the back of the building (two downstairs and two upstairs) each consist of two smaller sub-rooms: the classroom with chairs and the science lab with large metal tables. *There are four pairs of bathrooms on the map, with one pair per side per floor: **All male bathrooms are on the left, and all female bathrooms are on the right. **Each pair consists of a student's bathroom (labelled boys/girls) and a teacher's bathroom (labelled male/female). The teacher's bathroom is behind the \"regular\" bathroom (when looking towards the back). **The bathrooms are additionally labelled \"upstairs\" or \"downstairs\" respectively. *Classrooms numbered 20 and above are all located on the 2nd floor. The rest, classrooms 1-19, are downstairs. *The upstairs hallway is divided into three separate rooms by the game. The game calls each of these 6 hallway rooms a \"Corridor\" (rather than a \"Hallway\"). *In addition to doors and windows, fingerprints can also appear on bathroom mirrors. *The following rooms count as dim rooms and hence will drain sanity with 80% of the rate, even with all room lights being on: **Lobby, First Floor Main Corridor, First Floor Right Corridor, First Floor Left Corridor, Basketball Court, Lecture Hall, Second Floor Main Corridor, Second Floor Right Corridor, Second Floor Left Corridor. *Classroom 10 has no main room lights and hence no means of sanity drain prevention (other than firelights). ==Tips for surviving hunts== *Because of its many vast, empty rooms, the player should plan an escape route and identify a hiding spot as soon as the ghost is located, and always remain on their toes when investigating, especially if the favourite room is particularly expansive such as the Basketball Court or the Cafeteria. Be ready to run at the first sign of a hunt; using the brief grace period and strategic sprinting can make the difference between life and death. *This map is the only map in the game that has no official hiding spots at all; this means that only unofficial ones are available, which may not be reliable, and breaking line-of-sight to evade a ghost can be quite difficult due to how open the map is. Making sure to have Incense within reach can be very useful when still trying to collect evidence while sanity is nearing or below the hunt threshold, both to escape the ghost if spotted, and to prevent certain death if the ghost wanders into hiding spots. *Due to the very large size of the map, it may not even be necessary to hide if the player is sufficiently far from the ghost. The player can simply sit in a room far away from the ghost, as it would be extremely unlikely for it to wander by chance to the player's location if it has not detected them. **On the other hand, the large size of the map may make noticing the start of a hunt much more difficult. This can be particularly dangerous in hallways, as the player may be taken by surprise by a ghost that started hunting from far away. Communication between players and vigilance is key to avoid bad surprises; keeping exit doors open to hear or see them close and periodically trying to toggle light switches can help players know if a hunt started elsewhere in the building. *While all the lockers found on the map are simply decorative and therefore useless, the bathroom stalls are fair hiding spots during hunts, especially if the ghost does not see you enter the bathroom. *The Library contains several line-of-sight blockers, which can be used for both hiding and cutting off a chasing ghost. *The locker rooms on the left side of the first floor make for good hiding spots, as the lockers segregate the space and allow one to break line-of-sight or move away easier. *Some classrooms have hiding spots, such as in a corner next to some file cabinets, which block line-of-sight with the door. Knowing which ones do and which ones don't can save a player during hunts. Consider keeping open doors to classrooms with hiding spots and keeping closed those without. *The ghost is able to walk through many of the teacher's desks found in the classrooms, rendering them not useful for trying to loop the ghost. ==Bone locations== Bones spawn randomly, but will only spawn in areas that a ghost can also walk on. As Brownstone High School has a very large searchable area, looking for the bone is usually not a worthwhile endeavor; it is best either found incidentally or through use of a Ouija Board. ;Examples <small>Please note that the white bone model is no longer used.</small> <div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\"><gallery widths=\"185\"> Bone in Brownstone High School, First Floor, Right Side, Library.

Both rooms individually are also among the largest rooms in the game. * The assets used for this map can be found here. * There is a phone in every classroom that the ghost can ring as an interaction.

As such, <u>this page should not be used as a reference</u>, but instead as a novelty.</blockquote> This page lists several glitches or bugs that can be found in-game. == Acknowledged bugs == This is an informal list of bugs that have either been currently designated as \"known\" under the pinned comments of the #bug-reports channel of the official Discord server, or have a Known Issue tag to the relevant bug report. * If a player loads into a lobby while holding an item, it will appear floating * Hunts occasionally occur without anyone being in the house * Summoning circle candles can be rapidly lit to bypass the candles being blown out at 0 sanity * Bones occasionally spawn in inaccessible/difficult-to-reach areas * Players may not see items in the truck if someone loads in improperly * Lighting may appear warped in certain places * Some language fonts have white blocking around the letters * DOTS may not render correctly * Player hair can disappear in the fog or when viewed through the paramic * Sunny Meadows boilers cannot be lit * Prison monitors are very bright * Placing items (such as DOTS) may teleport it back to the truck * Items and props can spawn in the wrong place, and will bug the player's inventory when picked up * Multiple players can grab the same item at the same time, resulting in the item doubling or being unusable * Hands may fall when grabbing equipment in certain cases * Global Chat occasionally cuts out * Audio may muffle incorrectly between floors, when dying or being resurrected with High Priestess/Monkey Paw * Dead bodies may occasionally be invisible to some players * The map may disappear through doorways (portals) * There are places where the player can get stuck/be invincible * The player may get killed through the stairs in 42 Edgefield Road * Ghosts can get stuck behind certain furniture * The Deogen can kill through walls * The ghost may not hunt when all the Voodoo Doll pins are pulled at once * Journal case number may not match the paramic's * Video cameras may desync in position if a non-host player placed it * The ghost may not register moving between floors correctly, resulting in electronics not flickering * Airball event may not move to the player correctly * The mannequin being teleported in Edgefield may cause it to teleport into a hiding spot filled with boxes * Photos of the ghost can be duplicated if two players take it at exactly the same time * When loading back into the lobby, the difficulty will show as challenge mode while the host has not exit the debriefing screen * Using a text interface may soft lock the game if another player runs away with the equipment * Photos of certain things do not count under rugs * Lights may flicker infinitely after certain events/hunts * An extra character may sometimes appear in the lobby/map * Dying with the black fog effect via the Monkey Paw will cause it to persist for the rest of the round * Muting between the lobby and maps is not synced * Raindrops cannot be seen in certain cases * When ambient occlusion is turned off, odd reflections will appear * The ghost's footsteps and sounds may be inconsistent * Ghosts may remain invisible and not produce any footsteps if they started hunting while in D.O.T.S state == Informal bugs == <blockquote>This is not an exhaustive list.</blockquote> This is a list of bugs that have not been routinely acknowledged by the developers or Discord staff, though they may still be aware of the bugs. *Opening one tent door may sometimes open another tent door instead *A player's model may remain if they disconnect while finishing loading into the contract *Sound Monitor is sometimes desynced between players *Upon starting a contract, the exit door might be missing, allowing players to walk in without unlocking the door and thus keeping the ghost's AI into a \"standby\" state. Triggering a cursed hunt using a cursed possession will \"activate\" the ghost should this glitch happen. *Some props, cabinet doors or drawers might spawn floating outside the building *One blue bed model's LoS collider is too tall *The ghost sometimes spawns at the entrance room/wrong room at the start of the contract === \"Low to ground strategy\" === The low to ground strategy is a maneuver that can be performed by VR players in an attempt to avoid being killed during a hunt. It was fixed in the 0.26 update on 6 March 2021. A similar bug reoccurred in the VR Overhaul Update. To perform this maneuver, the player had to lie on their stomach or back as low to the ground as possible. A ghost successfully kills their target player when hunting by colliding with them, but reducing the character's size also reduces the chance of collision. In this case, the character's hitbox (an arbitrary shape that the game uses to determine whether the player is colliding with things) shortens and possibly descends into the floor, meaning that the ghost cannot touch it, and thus could not kill the player. Doing this could help the player get photographic evidence of the ghost by pointing a photo camera upwards and taking pictures, without risk of death. Youtuber hudzell released a video demonstrating this strategy in October 2020, adding during the video that players might not need to crouch too low to perform it. Players using this trick would find their vision possibly restricted from being prone (unless they lie on their back), and they may also find the experience physically uncomfortable. Also, moving too close to some objects may cause the player to go out of bounds, teleporting them back outside the house or in the truck. Obviously, Non-VR players cannot use this strategy, as they do not have the ability to lay down. == Notorious bugs == Below is a list of patched glitches that were either peculiarly game-breaking and/or gained significant notoriety in the community. === Door physics === In the past, door physics were notoriously janky and prone to many glitches. The most common was the ability to push into doors and tear them off their hinges into awkward angles. This did not, however, \"jam\" doors or prevent them from being closed/locked by the ghost, as they would reset to their normal position as soon as they were interacted with again. Door physics could also be exploited to traverse walls or cieilings, allowing players to go out of bounds or exit the investigation area during a hunt. For a short time after the early access Steam release, kitchen cupboard doors shared the same physics properties as passageway doors, allowing for certain exploits such as climbing on countertops, out of the ghost's reach. === \"Show us\" === During a brief period, saying the phrase \"show us\" would always force the ghost to perform an interaction no matter what. A widely-exploited side effect of this glitch was that it would immediately cancel ongoing hunts. This glitch became widely notorious at the time for its absurd power. === Hantu super speed === In version 0.7.1.4, a glitch was introduced causing the Hantu's ability of accelerating in cold rooms to increase the speed value exponentially. This led to astonishingly high speeds up to approximately 19 m/s, breaking the ghost's pathfinding and making hunts absurdly difficult to survive. == Not bugs == The following behaviours, although they may seem unexpected, are features working as designed/won't be fixed: * Maps are an ugly red and black when eye adaption is turned on, caused by an incompatible graphics card * Losing consumable items even when not dying (such as salt and sanity medication) * Seeing freezing breath with non-freezing ghosts. Since 0.9.0, freezing breath occurs whenever temperatures drop below 5°C (41°F). * The Goryo changing favorite room after using the \"I wish for sanity\" wish on the Monkey Paw. * UV flashlights not working when flashlights are disabled in the custom difficulty settings. * Summoning Circle candles extinguishing right after lighting them when at 0% sanity. * Crucifixes being used while inside the truck. Although very unexpected (usually occuring on 42 Edgefield Road due to the proximity of the truck to the house), this is simply due to the range-based functionality of the crucifix. * Labeled photos with no visible subject in the frame. Photos are intentionally not synched over with other players for performance reasons, therefore it is possible that photos taken by other players may appear incongruent in the journal. * Not being able to take photos of some interactions like opened doors or thrown objects. Since 0.13.0, photos of certain subjects have been removed, and must now instead be recorded using a Video Camera. == References == Category:Gameplay","title":"Glitches","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Glitches"}
{"content":"The Goryo is a type of ghost in Phasmophobia. Goryo are known for appearing only on video feeds when interacting with a D.O.T.S. Projector, as well as remaining within the vicinity of its starting Ghost Room. ==Behaviour== ===Activity=== When performing a roam, the Goryo can only perform short roams, rather than either short or long roams. The Goryo will not roam away from its favorite room as often as other ghosts and cannot change its favorite room in any difficulty. This can only be overridden via the 'sanity wish' when using the Monkey Paw. The Goryo will only enter in a D.O.T.S state if no players are in the same room as the ghost. In addition, its D.O.T.S silhouette is only visible through a Video Camera, and cannot be seen with the naked eye. A Goryo will still manifest normally during ghost events and hunts. The Goryo will enter the D.O.T.S state more frequently than other ghosts. ==Strengths and weaknesses== These are the strengths and weaknesses as listed in the journal: Strength: A Goryo will usually only show itself on camera if there are no people nearby. Weakness: They are rarely seen far from their place of death. ==Evidence== On limited evidence (1/2 evidence) games, a Goryo will always have the D.O.T.S. Projector as one of its evidence types. ==Strategies== ===Identification=== It is necessary to have a Video Camera either placed facing an active D.O.T.S. Projector, or held by a player outside the ghost's room. If D.O.T.S. evidence is visible in the camera's screen, but invisible in direct view, the ghost is likely to be a Goryo. Conversely, if D.O.T.S. is seen without the aid of a video camera, a Goryo can be safely ruled out. Turning up device or in-game brightness may help when trying to rule out a Goryo. Ghost events only need the player to be somewhat near the ghost, and the ghost does not need to roam to perform them, only teleporting if applicable. Hence, having ghost events happening a relatively long distance away from the favorite room does not rule out the Goryo; if it is from an extremely far distance however, then the Goryo can usually be ruled out. If the player did not obtain D.O.T.S Projector as one of the ghost's evidences on Nightmare/Insanity difficulty or on a limited evidence custom game (1/2 evidence), then the Goryo can be safely ruled out. On a custom difficulty with 0 evidence, the Goryo is near-impossible to identify with certainty, as it cannot be identified through its D.O.T.S ability, only its favorite room/roaming limitations, and as these are not definitive indications (other ghosts can also not change favorite rooms/roam far), at best only an educated guess based on its movements can be made; Try waiting a while to see if the ghost changes its favorite room at low sanity, or use motion sensors and salt to track how far it travels in one go. The ghost always hunting from the same room can also indicate a Goryo, especially if the custom difficulty has a high roaming frequency. ==Trivia== *In Japanese folklore, it was feared that when a person died tragically, their soul would become a vengeful spirit (commonly referred to as Onryō), causing disasters, pestilence, and haunting. People worshipped the Onryō as a Goryō (御霊, honorable spirit) and tried to avert disaster by appeasing his anger. The Japanese word \"御霊\" is often read as \"Mitama\" (\"Goryō\" is also the correct reading), which is a term of respectful invocation of ancestral spirits. In Phasmophobia, Goryo do not reflect these powers nor their Japanese origin, and are American in both appearance and name due to sharing models and a naming pool with other ghost types. *It is possible to take a D.O.T.S. Ghost photo of the Goryo's D.O.T.S. silhouette. This will require switching from a video camera to a photo camera at just the right moment if playing in singleplayer. Just as with the Phantom, the ghost won't actually be visible in the photograph, but it will still count toward the \"Capture a photo of the ghost\" optional objective. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !0.3.0 |Added Goryo. |- !0.8.0 |The Goryo will no longer change favourite rooms or roam long distances. |- !0.13.0 |The Goryo now has an increased chance to enter a D.O.T.S state. |}<br> ru:Горё fr:Goryo Category:Ghosts","title":"Goryo","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Goryo"}
{"content":"A ghost room, officially referred to as the favourite room, is a specific room in a map that the ghost will \"prefer\", or base specific actions upon. Those can be limited to whole rooms of a building but can also include hallways, enclosed areas, campsite tents, etc. Ghosts may leave their room while hunting or simply being more active due to a player's decreasing sanity, but in general, their activity will be localised to the favourite room and its immediate surroundings. Finding the favourite room in itself is not an objective, however, it simplifies the task of identifying the type of ghost correctly and allows players to record media more quickly. Depending on the difficulty, the ghost can decide to change its favourite room during the contract. The favourite room plays a lesser role once the type of ghost has been identified correctly and will usually serve as a reference for player activity during hunts. ==Mechanics== ===Favourite room=== Whenever a map is loaded in, one room in the area will be randomly selected as the favourite room. The favourite room is relevant for the following behaviours: *The ghost will teleport to the favourite room at the end of every hunt and when a crucifix has successfully prevented a hunt. *The ghost can roam back to the favourite room. *Ghost Orbs, if the ghost has it as evidence, will be present in the favourite room. **Though The Mimic doesn't have Ghost Orb among its types of evidence, it will still provide it as its weakness. *The Haunted Mirror will show a view of the favourite room. *The Hermit tarot card and the \"I wish to trap the ghost\" wish from the Monkey Paw will teleport the ghost to the favourite room and temporarily trap it there. *The Yurei will be sent back to the favourite room and stay within it for 90 seconds after being affected with Incense outside of a hunt. ===Ghost's current location/room=== As an invisible entity by default, ghosts can perform roaming simply to walk around. This can include roaming to another room; this does not change the favourite room. The following behaviours relate to where the ghost actually is: *Ghosts will interact with objects in a certain radius around itself. *Ghosts always start a hunt from its current position (except for The Twins in some cases). *Ghosts can initiate ghost events (naturally) if the player is within a certain range of the ghost. *For evidence to either be created and/or obtained, the ghost must be nearby (other than Ghost Orbs). *Ouija Board responses always give the ghost's current room, not the favourite one. Generally, ghosts will spend most of their time in the favourite room and will not roam far off. Still, they may move far away from their room if they have an ability that allows them to do so (the Wraith's teleport ability, the Banshee's roaming ability, and the Phantom's travel ability), or perform a ghost event on a player that is somewhat far from the ghost room (but not too far). These instances are technically not a \"roaming phase, \" but the ghost may roam after performing these actions. ===Changing favourite rooms=== Three criteria are used to determine whether the favourite room will change. Suppose the ghost performs a \"long roam\" and ends up in a room that is not its current favourite. In that case, the ghost will perform a chance roll based on the Changing favourite room difficulty setting: *None (Amateur, Intermediate): 0% *Low (Professional): 33% *Medium (Nightmare): 66% *High (Insanity): 100% If the chance above succeeds, a second chance roll is performed on the complement of the average sanity (or insanity); for example, an average sanity of 80% has a 20% chance of succeeding. If both chances are successful, the favourite room will change to the ghost's current room. The Goryo cannot change its favourite room by itself, even with the \"Changing favourite room\" parameter set to High. Using a specific Monkey Paw wish can force it to change the favourite room once. ===Disallowed favourite rooms=== Some maps have rooms such as corridors or hallways which cannot be chosen as the favourite room. The ghost can still roam into these rooms, provide evidence in these rooms, interact with items in or around the room, and spawn in these rooms during hunts or manifestations, but Ghost Orbs cannot be present in these rooms, the ghost will always fail its favourite room change roll if it ends up in one after a long roam, and it will not teleport to these rooms after a hunt. {| class=\"fandom-table mw-collapsible-content mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" !colspan=\"2\"|List of disallowed favourite rooms |- !colspan=\"2\"|Medium maps |- !Bleasdale Farmhouse | *Attic Hallway |- !Point Hope | *Bathroom Hallway *Master Bedroom Hallway *Child Bedroom Hallway *Balcony |- !Maple Lodge Campsite | *Campsite A *Campsite B *North East Path |- !Prison | *Main Hallway *Office Hallway |- !Sunny Meadows Restricted | *Padded Room 1 *Padded Room 2 *Connecting Corridor *Basement West Corridor *Basement East Corridor *Courtyard Corridor *Male Wing *Female Wing *Hospital Wing *Restricted Area *Left Entrance Stairwell |- !colspan=\"2\"|Large maps |- !Brownstone High School | *First Floor Main Corridor *First Floor Left Corridor *First Floor Right Corridor *Second Floor Main Corridor *Second Floor Left Corridor *Second Floor Right Corridor |- !Sunny Meadows | *Foyer *Padded Room 1 *Padded Room 2 *Connecting Corridor *Basement West Corridor *Basement East Corridor *Courtyard Corridor *Male Wing *Female Wing *Hospital Wing *Restricted Area *Left Entrance Stairwell *Right Entrance Stairwell *West Stairwell *East Stairwell |} ==Tips== *As the favourite room or the current location of the ghost can be a corridor, hallway, or large room, there may be difficulties for the players especially when it comes to the accurate use of equipment such as crucifixes and Incense. *Rooms on small maps containing stairways (i.e, basements in most houses, the Foyer on Ridgeview, etc.) will always include said stairway when chosen as a favourite room. ==See also== *Map (Segmentation) *Guides/Locating the ghost *Third-party tools#Evidence and map tools ==References== Category:Evidence Category:Map Features fr:Pièce hantée ru:Место обитания<!-- zh:鬼魂房间-->","title":"Ghost Room","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Ghost_Room"}
{"content":"An igniter is an item used to light incense, firelights, summoning circles, and fire sources. It emits a small amount of light when activated and held by the player. ==Usage== An igniter can be used either when held or when in the inventory. The igniter can be lit by pressing the key while holding it. Incense, fire sources and regular firelights can then be lit by aiming at the item and pressing the key. Alternatively, if the igniter is offhand in the inventory, incense or firelight being held on-hand can be lit directly with . The igniter does not have to be lit prior in this case, as it will automatically turn off when placed offhand. Igniters take up their own special slot in the inventory, allowing for three other items to be carried with them. Igniters have a limited amount of usable time, depending on their tier: *Tier I: 10 matches per box with 10 seconds per match, for a total of 100 seconds (1 minute 40 seconds) *Tier II: 5 minutes *Tier III: 10 minutes Additionally, lighting a held incense or firelight while the igniter is offhand in the inventory will instantly deduct 1 match for the Tier I and 15 seconds of the total fuel for the Tiers II and III. Active Tier I and Tier II igniters are affected by Heavy Rain, and will be extinguished automatically when taken outside and cannot be ignited in that weather, except in places that are covered from the rain (e.g. under porch roofs, inside tents). However, they can still light held incense and Tier III firelights up if they are in the inventory, even while fully outside. When an igniter is lit for the first time, contrary to other fire sources, it will not have the 30-second cooldown before the ghost can attempt to blow it out but a cooldown with a random duration between 20 and 80 seconds as with subsequent lightings (this might be a bug). The Onryo is the only ghost that can bypass this cooldown due to its hunt prevention mechanics. Ghosts cannot light igniters and have a 66.67% (2/3) chance to blow out a lit igniter provided they are within 5 meters and the cooldown is over. Tier I and II igniters are consumable, and will have to be repurchased after use. ==Tips== *While using tier I igniters, it is quicker to pick up, light and place firelights than to wait for the match-striking animation. ==Trivia== *The igniter is the cheapest item in the game, costing $10. *Tier I matches may be extinguished by the ghost, however, they will still appear to be lit. *In Point Hope and Bleasdale Farmhouse, a usable Tier I igniter containing a single matchstick spawns in one of the rooms. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !23 September 2020 | Lighters can now light held smudge sticks and candles. |- !0.3.0 |Changed the lighter model. |- !0.6.2.0 |Increased the limit of lighters per contract from 2 to 4. |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |0.9.0 |Lighters were renamed to igniters. |- |The Igniter now has 3 tiers. |- ! rowspan=\"3\" |0.10.0 |Players can now carry an Igniter in addition to 3 other items (Note: Non-VR players can only carry one Igniter at a time, similar to flashlights). |- |Igniters now have their own slot in the VR belt (When placing a tier 1 igniter in this slot, you won't be able to remove it again, until all matches have been drawn). |- |Firelights and Igniters will now be extinguished accurately in heavy rain.

{"content":"Maple Lodge Campsite is a map in Phasmophobia. It is the game's second medium map, and the first predominantly outdoors location. The map is a spacious campsite with multiple tents divided into two distinct campgrounds, as well as a restroom building, staff-only storage area, reception building, and a two-story cabin next to a lake. Its organic layout creates a stark contrast to the geometric and more familiar mechanics of the \"traditional\" indoors maps. Even more experienced players might find themselves lost and confused, as otherwise simple things such as finding the ghost room or locating fingerprints might not be as intuitive, and require more proactive search. However, the significant amount of segmented forking paths leads to plenty of different routes for getting to different parts of the map, which a cunning investigator can leverage to evade an aggressive ghost. Additionally, being mainly outdoors, weather plays a major factor during investigations on Maple Lodge. The temperature outside the cabin and reception building cannot be raised even by turning on the power; heavy rain will prevent the usage of candles and other open flames; while strong winds might hinder the hearing of sound cues such as items being thrown or the ghost's vocalizations while it is hunting. ==Structure== ===Layout tips=== *The key to the cabin can be found under the mat near its door. *The cabin's front doors cannot be unlocked during a hunt. However, once unlocked, these doors will never lock again, as opposed to exit doors. *The following areas cannot be chosen as a Ghost Room: **Campsite A **Campsite B **North East Path *Campfire A and Campfire B have no main room lights, so firelights are the only option to reduce sanity drain when in these rooms. *The following rooms don't completely prevent passive sanity drain even if all lights are turned on: **Campsite A **Cleaning Closet ===Key hiding spots and strategies=== There are 15 \"sanctioned\" hiding spots on Maple Lodge Campsite: *Entrance, behind dividers near door to Staff Storage Area *Staff Storage Area, behind boxes on the left of Storage Tent 2 *Staff Storage Area, chemical toilet near Storage Tent 2 *North East Path, behind a tarp and boxes *Picnic Area, behind multiple dividers near a boat *Cabin Bedroom, in the small gap where the staircase is *Campsite A, three small tents *Campsite A, behind dividers next to the small tents (only if there are two of them) *Campsite A, behind the Games Tent (only if there are no garbage cans blocking the path) *Campsite B, four small tents, two near Black Tent, one next to White Tent and another one between Blue Tent and Yellow Tent Depending on the difficulty, some of these hiding spots may be blocked by the presence of bulky items, be sealed behind locked doors, or have their concealing elements removed: *Amateur: None *Intermediate: 4 *Professional: 7 *Nightmare/Insanity: 11 *3-player game: +1 available hiding spot *4-player game: +2 available hiding spots <small>Additional hiding spots on multiplayer is overridden when \"Number of hiding places\" is set to None</small> *There are a few places to loop the ghost during a hunt such as the picnic tables or around a large portion of the map going across Reception Building, Campsite B, and Staff Storage Area. *The toilet stalls inside the restroom buildings serve as a decent hiding spot, as the ghost will rarely wander into the stall themselves unless the player attracts its attention. Keep the door of your cubicle held shut in case the ghost happens to wander in and attempt to open it, which would allow for it to spot you if it happens to see you in its peripheral vision while it is moving through that side of the restrooms. *Unlike regular doors, the tent flaps will not block line of sight with the ghost if they are not fully closed, even if the player holds them up so it completely hides their model. *The entrance gate produces a distinctive sound when compared to most other entrance doors when closed, which can be heard from most outdoors areas of the map. Hearing them shut with no one near them can provide a critical early warning of a hunt. *The ghost can't see players on the cabin's balcony from the Picnic Area, even when they are not crouched. *The ghost also can't see players that are far enough on the pier if it is on the cabin porch or in the section behind the cabin. This happens due to an invisible wall on the pier that begins after the first pole. If a player hides behind the chair at the far end of the pier, this serves as a decent hiding spot, as the chair breaks line of sight and the ghost needs to roam all the way down to the far end of the pier to see a player there. ===General tips=== *The campfires can be lit using a firelight or igniter. *In addition to existing \"common\" surfaces, fingerprints can also appear on the following items and surfaces: **Interior edges around tent door flaps **On tent windows **At the base of lanterns **On the string light poles and their switches **On picnic benches **On small tents **On the log seating ;Examples of fingerprints <gallery> File:Tent door fingerprint.png|Fingerprints on an interior edge around a tent door flap.

He can be seen near the truck, behind the Twig Doll easter egg in Campsite A, behind the small purple tent in Campsite B, near the Tarot Cards location in Picnic Area, or floating above water behind the cabin. *Blair Witch Twig Doll - At the fence by the Campfire A, a Twig Doll is hanging, which is a reference to the Blair Witch Project stick figures. *Corpse - A dead body can be found under the cabin. *The Ring - When either the television in the cabin or the fuse box is turned on and later turned off, there is a chance for a phone also in the cabin to ring. *Lighthouse - Standing on the pier (same area near the Jason Voorhees Mask) if one looks to the left side of the lake above the tree line there is a lighthouse in the distance. This was added in the 0.6.0 update. ==Gallery== <gallery> Winter Fairy Lights.png|Winter themed fairy/string lights during the 2021 Christmas event. Maple Lodge Geography.png|A map of the surrondings of Maple Lodge Campsite. </gallery> ==Trivia== *The map's name 'Maple' came from developer cjdxn's cat's name called 'Mayple'. *Some rooms need their small lamps to be turned on additionally to the main room lights to fully prevent the sanity drain. These rooms are Entrance, Staff Storage Area, Storage Tent 1, Campsite B, Picnic Area, Cabin Living Room, and Cabin Bedroom. *Maple Lodge Campsite is the only map that has lights that prevent sanity drain for multiple rooms: the light switches in both Female Toilets (the one in the bathroom, not the one on the pole) and Male Toilets count for their respective room, as well as for Cleaning Closet. <!-- I was thinking about adding poorly lit rooms and the required amount of light switches for sanity drain prevention, but this would clog the pages, maybe sub-pages? I hid the following text for now, I'm open to suggestions where to put it. I might have forgotten some rooms... **The Cleaning Closet counts as poorly lit. **In Campsite A, apart from the main light, there is a small portable lamp on a pole next to Games Tent that is required. However, this room still counts as poorly lit. **Female Toilets requires the light in the bathroom and the one on the pole next to the bathroom entrance. **Pier requires two portable lamps, one on the boat dock and one at the chairs behind the Cabin.--> *Contrary to Camp Woodwind, Maple Lodge Campsite's campfires don't heat the room they are in when lit. This is likely a bug. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !0.4.0 |Added the Maple Lodge Campsite map. |- !0.4.1.0 |A new path has been created from the entrance to the campfire area. |- !0.6.2.0 |The campfire now raises the temperature of the area around it when lit. |- !0.9.1.0 |Complete layout revamp, featuring a new reception building, two separate campsite areas, new assets and areas, more hiding spots and greatly improved performance. |} ==References== Category:Maps Category:Medium Map fr:Maple Lodge Campsite ru:Maple Lodge Campsite","title":"Maple Lodge Campsite","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Maple_Lodge_Campsite"}

Possibly harmless, but be careful out there. * No report this time. Be careful, you're going in blind. * Nothing to report, but it looks like whoever was here left in a hurry. * There's been no reports of violence or sightings, but please remain careful. * We've had no reports of violence, but keep an eye out. ; Added in 0.5.0 * The ghost here seems to be linked to a cursed object. Go and take a closer look, maybe using it will help your investigation. * There’ve been new reports of a cursed object nearby. This must be the reason that the ghost was summoned here. Take a look, you may be able to use it to your advantage. * Whoever was here must have summoned the ghost with a cursed object. Investigate it, but be careful. We don't know what it's capable of. === Key === If any player leaves the truck before the house key has been collected, the instructor will remind the players to collect it: * I managed to get a copy of the key. I've left it on the desk for you. * The owner left us a key. It's ready on the desk for you. === Prestige === When the player reaches level 100: * We want to offer you a special kind of promotion. * If you'd like to progress, you can now prestige. * We'd like to offer you a promotion.

{"content":"Lights are a map feature that facilitate navigation across the investigation area as well as providing a way to mitigate sanity drain. ==Mechanics== .]] .]] There are several elements counting as lights: ceiling lights, lamps, TVs, and computers. When the fuse box is on, players can toggle these on or off by with their respective switch: a wall switch for ceiling lights, the lamp itself for lamps, a TV remote for TVs, and the keyboard for computers. If the TV remote is held, players will instead need to press the button. Ghosts can also interact with the switch to toggle the lights, and will leave fingerprints on it if Ultraviolet is among their types of evidence. Occasionally, ghosts may perform a special interaction with turned on lights, making them flicker for a short duration. An EMF Level 2 reading (33% chance to be an EMF Level 5 reading instead for applicable ghosts) will be left on the switch in all these cases. Outside of hunts, lights will sometimes flicker near the ghost without any EMF reading being created. The player will also start seeing lights flickering across the entire map when their own sanity is below 50%, but these flickers are only \"imaginary\" as they cannot be recorded in the journal and other players cannot see them. Lights in the player's current room will turn off at the start of a ghost event. There are two exceptions: the lights will turn off at the end of the event if it is a red-light event, and the lights will flicker before shattering if it is a light-shattering event. For all ghost events, ghosts will never leave EMF readings on the light switches. During a hunt, ghosts will make lights flicker within 10 metres on the same floor, and light switches cannot be toggled and will turn off at the end of the hunt. All switches also turn off when the fuse box trips. ===Affecting sanity=== ===Rewards=== Filming a light switch being toggled by the ghost will yield a Lights Switched video in the journal, rewarding up to $7 and 7 XP, depending on the tier of the video camera and whether there is a Unique stamp. Two other videos, rewarding up to $12 and 12 XP, can be captured from lights: a Light Exploded video upon capturing lights exploding, and a Light Flickering video upon capturing lights flickering outside of hunts.

{"content":"Ghost model is the appearance of a ghost. There are currently seven male and four female ghost models in Phasmophobia, totalling 11 different ghost models. Each model can also appear as a shadowy or translucent version of itself during ghost events. While no singular ghost model is tied to a type of ghost, the Banshee and the Dayan are always female and can only use female ghost models, allowing players to rule them out if the ghost appears with a male model. The model of the ghost may conflict with information gathered from the Spirit Box and Ouija Board; ghosts labeled as \"old\" may have one of the models that one would equate to a child, for example. == Male models == <gallery mode=\"packed\"> File:2.png File:Ghost Male Greybeard.png File:4.png File:3.png File:Ghost Male Nerd.png File:Ghost Male Sofia.png File:Ghost Male Butcher.png </gallery> == Female models == <gallery mode=\"packed\"> File:Ghost Argyro.png File:Ghost CreepyGirl.png File:Ghost OldCrone.png File:Ghost RingGirlUPDATED.png|This ghost model is semi-officially called Patient 07. </gallery> == Postures == The child and \"Patient 07\" models have multiple postures that they can switch into during a contract.

On April Fools' 2023, all ghosts had a bigger head. For Christmas 2023, the ghost would transform into a snowman after all dancing snowmen of the map were destroyed. Its footsteps were accompanied by ringing bells. For Easter 2024, the ghost on Camp Woodwind would become a Forest Spirit after all five of its minions are photographed. The Forest Spirit came back for Easter 2025 and would appear on maps featuring the Cursed Hollow event. This model is considered female. For the Winter's Jest event, ghosts on specific maps used a special Krampus model.

{"content":"The Journal is the main piece of equipment in Phasmophobia. It contains important information relevant to Ghosts, Evidence, Media and mission data. It is divided up into 5 categories with specific focuses, used to aid players on cases. The journal is always accessible to the player any time while in a contract or in the lobby. ==Usage== The Journal can be opened by pressing the button, or grabbing the book from the toolbelt on VR. Upon opening it for the first time, players will be greeted with a contents page outlining each section of the book. Several bookmarks are also visible at the top of the journal, allowing players to quickly switch between sections. ===Home=== This section outlines the fundamentals and basic game mechanics in Phasmophobia, including subsections on sanity and tools. ===Items=== This section provides information on payment bonuses, cursed possessions, and gathering evidence. ===Overview=== The Overview page is a single page detailing information unique to the specific case a player is on. From here, players can view: *The ghost's name *Who it responds to *Any collected keys *All optional objectives This allows players to check objectives and case information on-the-go without needing to constantly run back to the truck. ===Media=== This section is a 5-page section containing all of the photos, videos, and sounds that players have collected on a case. Several pieces of media can be deleted per contract, depending on the difficulty: *0x - 1.99x: 5 available deletions *2x - 2.99x: 4 available deletions *3x or higher: 3 available deletions ===Evidence=== The evidence page shows all potential evidence items and the ghosts that correspond to them. From here, evidence can be either checked off or crossed out, which in turn causes ghosts on the page to grey out, signifying they are no longer possible suspects. Crossing out evidence can greatly reduce the number of potential ghosts remaining, making it essential for quick missions. By default, the Spirit is selected as the default ghost. ===Ghosts=== The Ghosts page contains a list of all 27 available ghosts in Phasmophobia. Clicking onto a specific ghost will cause the rightmost page to display its strengths, weaknesses, and potential evidence items. ===Pause menu=== Shows the pause menu, also reachable by pressing the button. The player can also access most in-game options. This will also show the Recent Players, Blocked Players, and Statistics bookmarks. ===Recent players=== This shows a two-page list of all recent players that have joined the same lobby as the user.

{"content":"The Hantu is a type of ghost in Phasmophobia. They are known for their increased speed in colder rooms, which can make them an unexpected threat during a hunt. ==Behaviour == === Activity === The Hantu cannot turn on the fuse box, and is twice as likely to turn it off. === Hunt === During a hunt, the Hantu's speed is affected by the temperature of the room that it goes through: {| class=\"article-table\" ! Room temperature ! Ghost speed (m/s) |- | > | 1.4 |- | | 1.75 |- | | 2.1 |- | | 2.3 |- | | 2.4 |- | | 2.5 |- | < | 2.7 |}<br>Unlike most other ghosts, the Hantu does not have line-of-sight acceleration during hunts. During a hunt, the Hantu will emit freezing breath near its head in any room as long as the fuse box is off. Dead players cannot see this breath. As this is not actual \"evidence\", it can appear on any difficulty. == Strengths and weaknesses == These are the strengths and weaknesses as listed in the journal: Strength: Lower temperatures allow the Hantu to move at faster speeds. Weakness: Hantus move slower in warmer areas. ==Evidence== On limited evidence (1/2 evidence) games, a Hantu will always have Freezing Temperatures as one of its evidence types. == Strategies== Temperature plays an important role in both identifying and defending against a Hantu. In general, Hantus will be most powerful within and near the ghost room, where low and freezing temperatures are most likely to be. Thus, it is important that players get away from the ghost (room) as soon as a hunt begins, as the Hantu can quickly catch someone within its vicinity. Hantus are particularly dangerous during Light Snow weather, especially on the outdoors maps of Maple Lodge Campsite and Camp Woodwind, as ambient room temperatures will generally be lower if the fuse box is off, boosting their speed during a hunt. In general, leaving the breaker turned on is a safer strategy, though one can also turn it off to aid in identification, if needed. === Identification === There are three ways to identify a Hantu: * Leave the fuse box turned on for a while, then listen for its speed during a hunt. If it is faster in colder rooms (usually, but not always the favourite room), and slower than a normal ghost in a warm room, then it is a Hantu; this can usually be identified safely from a hiding spot, by using its notoriously uneven footsteps, with the rate of footsteps changing suddenly and seemingly randomly as it changes between different speeds. ** If it is a Raiju, then the ghost will be fast near active electronics and a normal speed outside a specified range. If this is a no-evidence game, try removing all electronics first. If at least one piece of evidence is provided, then having Freezing Temperatures as a piece of evidence will eliminate Raiju. ** Similarly, if it is a Jinn, it will speed up when spotting a faraway player, as the fuse box is turned on; have all players hidden out of sight to prevent a misidentification, or turn off the fuse box just before/during the hunt. ** The Moroi can also speed up over several hunts or even during a hunt, but as a result of gradually lowering average sanity instead. Ensure that all players maintain their sanities at a constant level, and do not take Sanity Medication/use sanity-draining cursed possessions during a hunt, which induces a sudden, very noticeable speed change in a Moroi, possibly causing a misidentification. * The Hantu's ability to emit freezing breath when the breaker is off can be used to definitively identify it without evidence, though it is more risky than the other strategies. Look closely! Use Incense to stun it while it's hunting. * Leave the breaker turned on for a while, then loop it around a large piece of furniture in a warm room during a hunt, carrying Incense to avoid death. If the ghost does not speed up with line-of-sight and does not have any other noticeable speed differences that could point towards another ghost, then it is likely a Hantu. It is worth noting the mere presence of the ghost in that room will cool it down and make it increasingly harder to loop over time; this is usually irrelevant in small maps which have shorter hunt durations, and looping a Hantu for an entire hunt is feasible, but on medium and large maps and/or when the hunt duration is extended by cursed hunts, such looping should not be done over an extended period of time, or alternatively one should utilize a loop or series of loops that spans multiple rooms. ** For reference, if the player is continuously sprinting off-cooldown, their average speed is 2.125 m/s; this means the Hantu is significantly slower than the player in rooms that are >12°C, roughly the same speed in rooms that are 9-12°C, and faster than the player in rooms that are <9°C. Having a tier I Thermometer out while looping the ghost can help identify when temperatures are approaching dangerous levels and the player should switch to loop in another room/find a hiding spot. ** If ambient temperatures are high and the player is confident enough in their looping skills, the player can opt to loop the ghost with the breaker off instead, allowing them to look for a Hantu's signature freezing breath at the same time. If you do not obtain Freezing Temperatures as one of the ghost's types of evidence on a limited evidence custom game (1/2 evidence), then the Hantu can be safely ruled out. It also cannot turn on fuse boxes, so if this happens, the ghost is not a Hantu. The Hantu is one of two ghosts (the other being the Onryo) for which you can collect all three pieces of evidence without excluding The Mimic. Therefore, before concluding you're dealing with a Hantu, confirm that it is actually a Hantu using the above methods and/or check whether the Spirit Box gives a response. If it does, you have The Mimic instead. ==Trivia== *\"Hantu\" translates from the Indonesian/Malay languages to spirit or ghost, and generally refers to spirits of the dead, but they can also be other invisible supernatural beings such as Demons.

{"content":"This guide will teach you how to locate the ghost in Phasmophobia. Depending on the ghost type, the difficulty level as well as direct player activity determining where the ghost currently is on a map can be a tedious task, especially on larger maps. Identifying the ghost's location correctly can save a lot of time (and lives) while identifying its nature. Certain items can help players trap the ghost in its room and prevent it from initialising hunts for a period of time. ==Location methods== Generally, the location of a ghost can be split into three categories: * Favourite room * Ghost's current room * Ghost's current location It is important to know the distinction between the ghost's favourite room (a.k.a. \"ghost room\") and its current room. The favourite room is a specific room in the map where the ghost teleports back to after every hunt, as well as where Ghost Orbs will appear. On the other hand, the ghost's current room is where the ghost physically is, and does not have to be the favourite room. Generally, identifying both the favourite room and the ghost's current location will aid the investigation. The setting up of equipment will mostly be centred around the favourite room. Depending on the room size, you may need to watch out for the ghost moving favourite rooms (only on difficulties where this can occur, e.g. Professional, Nightmare, and Insanity), and place your equipment accordingly. This will mostly occur in small or tight rooms like bathrooms and hallways of houses. Some of these tips may be useful for the initial finding of the ghost, while some are better used later into the investigation. ==By interactions== In most cases, ghosts can interact with items that are up to 2.12 metres away (4.24 metres on large maps) of its current position. The exceptions (relevant for this section) are: * All ghosts can turn on/off the fuse box remotely. * The Twins can interact with objects up to 8.48 metres away (16.97 metres on large maps) when it uses its ability, which may result in red herrings. * The Yurei can interact with a random opened door in its current room to close it (not necessarily within the interaction range) when it uses its sanity drain ability. Generally, interactions occur at a varying rate of approximately 1 - 3 per minute, which may depend on the ghost type. Interactions can help to pinpoint the ghost's current location, though not necessarily its current room (since ghosts can interact through walls) or favourite room. ===Visual and audio clues=== One way to identify interactions is to silently walk around and look carefully for sounds produced by the ghost or objects being out of place. For example: ====Visual and audio==== *Doors being unexpectedly opened or closed, or seen being moved without anyone nearby. The sound produced by a ghost when touching a door is distinct from the sound that players cause *A faucet (i.e. Dirty Water) or shower running *An item being thrown or hitting the floor/being out of place, like food utensils or paintings being on the floor *Car alarms, televisions, or computers being turned on *Light switches being turned on/off, or being unexpectedly turned on *Fans rumbling *A piano key being pressed *A rocking chair rocking *Sunny Meadows - Crosses found hung on walls being turned upside down *Sunny Meadows - Metronomes being turned on *Sunny Meadows - Alarm clocks being turned on ====Audio only==== *Phones ringing *Radios (not player walkie-talkies) being turned on *Teddy bears giggling *Window knocks *Guitars being strummed ====Visual only==== *Mannequins being rotated or teleported; the location where the mannequin was teleported from is where the ghost was *Teddy bear head being turned *Teddy bear/bunny/ball being teleported ===EMF Reader=== Generally, most out-of-place objects will be obvious enough to identify, but some may be easier to miss. In this case, carrying an EMF reader will help to identify the exact object that was thrown recently. All interactions generate an EMF reading that lasts 20 seconds, so once you hear or see something, use the reader to identify which item it was. ==Temperature== Using a thermometer can be useful in locating the ghost. Ghosts lower the temperature of the room that they are currently in to a certain point, regardless of whether they are inside or outside. ===Temperature ranges=== Ghosts cool down the room that they are currently occupying. When a room is at its coldest, the temperature reading range on the thermometer will be as follows: * Ghosts with Freezing Temperatures as evidence: * Ghosts without Freezing Temperatures as evidence: At the start of the game, all rooms (including the ghost's current room) start at either the maximum possible temperature (if the fuse box starts on and the room is considered indoors), or at the weather's ambient temperature. As thermometers only have a fluctuation upwards, reading a temperature below the starting temperature (either maximum or ambient depending on the factors above) means that the ghost has spent some time in that specific room. Turning the fuse box on will warm up indoors areas, which can help in distinguishing rooms where the ghost has been from rooms where it has not been. Temperatures slowly rise if the ghost is not present in a room. Do not assume that the ghost is still in a room just because it is cold, as it may take a few minutes after the ghost leaves a room for it to no longer be cold. Some maps have special mechanics to keep in mind: *Lighting the campfire on Camp Woodwind will warm up the Campfire room even if the ghost is in that room. *Turning on the fuse box on Nell's Diner will cool down the Cooler Room even if the ghost is not in that room. ==Using cursed possessions== ;Haunted Mirror Using a haunted mirror will show the interior of the favourite room. The danger of using a haunted mirror is the rapid sanity drain, and once the user's sanity reaches zero, a cursed hunt will be initiated. The haunted mirror is best used very early into the game, allowing players to setup equipment early. ;Music Box Activating a music box will cause the ghost to sing along with the tune, and the ghost's singing will be louder the closer you are to it. Players can then listen closely for the direction where the singing is coming from. While its singing can only be heard if the music box is within 20 metres of it, the music box will otherwise function globally. Players should weigh finding the ghost against prematurely starting a hunt or capitalizing on the triggered ghost event, especially on smaller maps where ghost is more likely to be nearby. ;Ouija Board If spawned, a Ouija Board can be used to ask questions about the ghost's location such: *\"Where are you?\" *\"What is your room?\" *\"What is your favorite room?\" The Ouija Board will always reply with the ghost's current room and not the favourite room, no matter how the question is phrased. The name of the room that it gives is sometimes obvious (e.g. \"Kitchen\", \"Foyer\") but other times, the name of an unfamiliar room can be only determined by placing sound sensors in each room and referring to the name listed on the Sound Monitor. As the ghost may have moved to a different room by the time the player figures out the answer and makes their way to the room, answers should only be interpreted as a general direction and not a pin-point indication. Note that location questions will deduct a whopping 50% sanity from the player who asked it. If the player does not have enough sanity to \"pay\" for the question, the Ouija Board will break and trigger a cursed hunt. Therefore, it is recommended that the player asks early into the game when sanity is generally still high. ;Voodoo Doll The voodoo doll can be used to force the ghost to perform an interaction, which can be found as described in the earlier section. Note that each pin inserted deducts 5% of sanity from the user, while pushing the heart pin (or having not enough sanity) will deduct 10% of their sanity and start a cursed hunt. ;Tarot Cards Several cards may help to identify the ghost's current location or favourite room: *The Tower tarot card will double the rate of ghost activity for the next 20 seconds. *The Hermit will trap the ghost in its favourite room for 60 seconds, but will not prevent ghost events or hunts; if it hunts from a certain room within the specified duration, then that will be the favourite room. However, manifestation ghost events will still teleport the ghost, ignoring the card's effects. * If your risk tolerance is high, pulling a Death card can help to identify where the ghost was when it started its hunt. Most other possible cards are less useful in terms of finding where the ghost is, or even detrimental to the player, and hence usage of these cards should be carefully considered. *The The Devil card will trigger a ghost event, however, it will do so by teleporting the ghost to the nearest player (for manifestation events). The location of the ghost event therefore does not necessarily indicate the favourite room or ghost's location. ;Monkey Paw A few wishes from the Monkey Paw can be used to assist in locating the ghost, with an added complication for the specific wish used: *\"I wish to trap the ghost\" will lock the ghost in its favourite room, and prevent it from doing anything for one minute. This is not very useful in singleplayer, as all doors in the room where the wish was called upon will also lock, trapping the wisher, but in multiplayer, the rest of the team can simply walk around and find whichever other room is locked down to find the ghost's location. Alternatively, if the map has a room that can be exited without going through a door, the wish can be used there in singleplayer without trapping the wisher. This should be done with a degree of haste, however, as after the end of this minute, the ghost will begin a hunt. The player calling on this wish should also have Incense handy in case they end up getting locked in with the ghost. *\"I wish for activity\" will double the rate of all ghost activity, including interactions, events, roaming, and abilities, for two minutes. However, the fuse box will permanently break, and exit doors will be locked for two minutes. *\"I wish to be sane\", past its effects on sanity, will force the ghost to change favourite rooms to a random one. While this is a hindrance in most cases, it can be useful on larger maps where the ghost is in a very distant room (such as the Kitchen and its side rooms in Sunny Meadows) or an extremely large room (such as the Basketball Court in Brownstone High School) both of which can hinder investigations greatly, and forcing it to pick a new one is desirable, especially if sanity has dropped to the point where the ghost is chain-hunting and preventing further investigation. ==Other equipment and evidences== ;Ghost Orb The live video feed on a video camera allows a player to find ghost orbs on the spot by carrying a video camera and watching the video feed. If a ghost orb appears inside a room, that room is guaranteed to be the favourite room. Ghost orbs are generated when all players have loaded in, making it also possible to view them with a CCTV camera on larger maps even before any exit doors have been unlocked, if the camera happens to have a view of the favourite room. On difficulties where the favourite room can change, periodically verifying the location of ghost orbs helps players to determine whether the favourite room has changed, signalling the time to move equipment. Note that Ghost Orbs is not always one of the ghost's evidences (or is hidden as an evidence), so be careful not to assume that the ghost is not in a particular room if there are no ghost orbs. ;Parabolic Microphone Using a parabolic microphone (also known as a paramic) may help to narrow down the ghost's location. It has a detection range of 20 or 30 metres forward (depending on its tier), and can detect any sound caused by the ghost, including footsteps, whispers, and interactions with the environment. Keep in mind that the paramic also reads sounds that could be caused by a player, such as doors being closed or objects being thrown. Spirit box static, and ambient sounds on a few maps, will also be read by the paramic. ==After finding the ghost (room)== ;Motion Sensor Motion sensors can be used to track the ghost's movement, which can be useful to look for roaming patterns that can help setting up equipment more efficiently or locate the ghost's current position. Be aware of other players (including dead ones) that will also trigger motion sensors. ;Incense The \"Cleanse the area near the ghost with Incense\" objective completes when the incense's effect applies within 3 to 5 metres of a ghost (depending on its tier). After the ghost has already been located, this may be useful in verifying that the ghost is still nearby, and for a Yurei, will also help to limit its movement to its favourite room in the 90 seconds following the cleansing. If this objective does not complete after using the incense, it may mean that the ghost is not near enough, and has moved away to another location (though this may still be within the room). ;Sound Sensor As sound sensors are limited by range, one can use them to see if the ghost is still in its room. Like the parabolic microphone, sound sensors can detect sounds through walls within its coverage area and provide feedback to the truck of the sum of all sounds detected, allowing players to monitor activity from the safety of the truck and verify its location. Sound sensors are used most efficiently by covering the favourite room and its immediate area. Note that just like the parabolic microphone, sound sensors can also pick up some player-made sounds. ;Spirit Box If the ghost has Spirit Box as one of its evidence, you can use this to identify its general location. The ghost will only respond through the spirit box if the player asking questions is in the same room as it and within a certain range. Thus, the spirit box can help to identify the ghost's current room and its approximate location. Although the spirit box can identify both the ghost's current room and its approximate location, using the spirit box and continuously walking from room to room may be a noisy and tiring task. Hence, the spirit box is generally used only after the room has already been found and its evidence has been confirmed. ==Other tips== ===Preserving sanity=== Often, it is ideal to preserve the overall team sanity so that there is enough time to collect evidence before the ghost hunts, if needed. This happens by preventing passive sanity drain: *On suburban house maps, the simplest way is to turn on lights in frequented areas and in rooms that you are currently standing in (unless you are looking for certain evidence like Ghost Orbs and Spirit Box). The downside to this (before the ghost has been found) is that ghosts that are currently in lit rooms cannot throw items (EMF 3), though they can still perform interactions that cause EMF 2. In addition, this is less helpful or downright useless in most other maps, since light sources are generally too \"dim\" to slow sanity drain on average. *On larger maps or in general, another way is to continuously hold a lit firelight, and an igniter offhand if needed; this will slow the passive sanity drain down, and will theoretically grant a longer time to find the ghost. However, this will limit one's ability to carry other items; balance this against evidence collection and objective completion. A decent compromise is to set lit firelights in the ghost room and along the path that the player needs to take to get to the ghost room, but this in turn can cause their fuel to burn out rapidly (if the player does not have tier III firelights) without fully utilizing their sanity drain reduction, and leave the player with no firelights when they need the effect later on. ===Hunts=== When a hunt ends, the ghost will be teleported to the favourite room. If interactions occur in a certain room shortly after a hunt ends, then that may be the favourite room (or nearby), especially if it is \"chain-hunting\" and hence returning to its favourite room more often. You may also pay attention to the ghost's starting point to narrow down the favourite room; the location where a hunt begins is usually in/near the favourite room, as hunts always start from the ghost's current location, except for The Twins. Keep in mind that the Wraith, the Banshee, and the Phantom have special movement abilities which may lead to hunts starting far away from the favourite room. If the player has a particularly high risk tolerance and/or confidence in their skills, simply triggering a cursed hunt can be a fair method of locating the ghost. ===Hunt interactions=== During a hunt, ghosts will throw items at fairly frequent intervals, as well as interact with doors along the way. If you find an abnormal number of doors open (especially with the 'Doors starting open' difficulty option set to None) or items thrown on the floor, then the ghost is likely to have walked through the area while hunting. Note that ghosts can choose not to open doors or throw items, or there were simply no props near the ghost for it to do so. ===Increasing the chance of being given a clue=== Saying recognised phrases such as \"give us a sign\" has a chance of causing the ghost to perform an interaction, though the player must be in the same room as the ghost, and there is a 10 second cooldown on this chance being triggered. This means that walking around repeatedly saying trigger phrases may be more detrimental as opposed to listening carefully for any interactions the ghost performs naturally. Simply talking near a Yokai will also increase its activity and its hunt sanity threshold. Note that no phrase can \"force\" the ghost to perform particular types of interactions. ===Avoiding red herrings or errors=== In any difficulty, the ghost is just as likely to wander around and cause disturbance outside the favourite room. In Professional, Nightmare, and Insanity difficulties, the favourite room itself may change. In either case, other than when detecting Ghost Orbs, placing and using equipment in both the suspected favourite room and surrounding areas where the ghost may wander will help to reduce hassle in moving equipment between rooms. ===Dead players=== If a player died before the ghost could be found, they may produce various red herrings from beyond the grave, whether it be of malicious intent or purely accidental. Dead players will trigger motion sensors just like the ghost, which may significantly misdirect or confuse remaining players of the whereabouts of the ghost, though a motion sensor getting frequently triggered is usually a sign of a dead player. Additionally, dead players often have the habit of throwing/moving the props around the map to pass time, which can sometimes be mistaken for ghost interactions. Noticing regular items being dropped or piled, or thrown directly at alive players in a humorous manner is the sign of a dead player interacting and not a ghost. Moreover, objects being displaced by dead players will never emit noise or give out EMF readings. ===Sounds=== Some maps have \"ambient\" sounds that play randomly at random locations. These ambient sounds are not produced by the ghost, although they may initially be confused for ghost sounds. Examples include: the little \"cling\" sounds that are often heard in Prison, branches cracking in Maple Lodge Campsite, the distant screams heard on Sunny Meadows Mental Institution, and the creaking and settling of floors on most house maps. These are produced randomly by the map itself, and the ghost does not create them and do not help in locating it. In contrast, the sound of a cell door opening or closing is not an ambient sound and can only be caused by either the ghost or a player opening or closing a cell door. During bad weather (e.g. heavy rain), one may mistake ambient sounds for ghost activities such as window knocks; use an EMF reader to verify whether the ghost actually knocked a window. ===The Mimic=== The Mimic can copy any ghost type, including the Twins. While being that type, it can mislead and confuse players even further, letting them to believe that the favourite room was not identified correctly. Always be on the lookout for orbs; having a video camera in the general area of manifestations is crucial for knowing both what type of ghost it is and where it(s favourite room) currently is. ==See also== *Identifying ghosts Category:Guides fr:Guides/Localiser l'entité","title":"Guides/Locating the ghost","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Guides/Locating_the_ghost"}
{"content":"A ghost event is a manifestation of the ghost in the mortal world other than a hunt and which does not directly interact with the environment (unlike an interaction). Ghost events vary from full on physical apparitions to mere balls of smoke and usually produce sound (hissing, moaning, chanting etc.) perceivable without the use of specialized equipment. ==Mechanics== ===Triggering ghost events=== When the ghost attempts to perform a ghost event, it will check for players in the investigation area within a certain range (tested to be 15 metres) on the same floor. If successful, the closest player within the range will be chosen as the ghost event's target each time. If the ghost chooses to manifest, it will be teleported to near the player first. Ghosts do not teleport for mist form events. An EMF 4 reading will be generated at the point where the ghost is at the start of the event. Players can trigger ghost events by drawing The Devil card from a deck of Tarot Cards. Some other cursed possessions can trigger specialised ghost events. Otherwise, ghost events are random, and a lower average sanity increases the chance of them occurring. Neither smudging nor verbally provoking the ghost will increase the chance of a ghost event. ===Blacklisted rooms=== Ghosts cannot perform ghost events towards a player if the latter is standing in the following rooms: {| class=\"fandom-table\" !Bleasdale Farmhouse !Point Hope !Prison !Brownstone High School !Sunny Meadows |- | *Kitchen *Trophy Room *Attic Bedroom | *Kitchen *Maintenance Room *Lantern Room Bottom | *Office Hallway | *Lobby *First Floor Main Corridor *First Floor Left Corridor *First Floor Right Corridor *Second Floor Main Corridor *Second Floor Left Corridor *Second Floor Right Corridor *Classroom 1 *Classroom 14 | *Female Day Room *Male Bathroom *Basement West Corridor *East Visitors' Room *Restricted Area *Courtyard Corridor *Female Wing *Male Wing |} <br>Ghosts and the mist form can still follow a player into these rooms from an adjacent room. Events caused by cursed possessions can also bypass this restriction. Currently, the general rule of thumb is that if the targeted room does not have any doors connected to it (i.e. actually linked to the room, meaning they close when using the Monkey Paw's trap wish), is not part of a basement, and is not on a small map, then the ghost will be unable to perform an event by itself. Maple Lodge Campsite does not have blacklisted rooms as the ground floor/camping grounds is actually considered a basement. The \"fake hunt without vocalisations\" ghost event is still possible in these rooms (but this type of ghost event is currently bugged, see below). It is unknown whether this is intended. ===Types of events=== ====Manifestation==== When the ghost chooses to manifest, there are several subtypes which it may perform: *The ghost stands in one spot and sings; this is usually known as a singing event. Male ghosts will hum an unknown, low-tone tune, while female ghosts will sing Ring a Ring o' Roses. **For the Krampus model during the Winter's Jest event, this was another ~30-second tune. **For the forest spirit model during Easter events, this was the female vocalisation played backwards. **For the snowman model during the Holiday 2023 event, this was a variation of Jingle Bells. *The ghost remains stationary. One of three things will happen: **No additional features other than the lights in the room turning off. **All lights in the room will be glowing red for the duration of the event before turning off. **All lights in the room will flicker (if turned on), then shatter at the end of the event. *The ghost chases and walks towards the player who triggered the event. If it goes near enough to the player, it will disappear and hiss sharply. Otherwise, it will disappear without any sound if enough time has elapsed. The ghost will walk at the standard ghost speed of 1.7 m/s, regardless of ghost type or ghost speed settings. This is known as a fake hunt event and it creates two EMF 4 readings instead of one. **The fake hunt event has a variant where the ghost does not produce vocalisations. This event can't occur if the room the target player is in doesn't have lights. This variant is bugged since 0.10.0; the event will only turn the lights off and the ghost will spawn in, visible for a single frame. In all subtypes except for the singing event, the ghost will select a random hunt vocalisation. During the event, many things will happen: *The ghost will manifest in either its full form, a shadow which is only visible under light, or a jelly-like, almost see-through form. *Nearby electronics will malfunction and lights will flicker, giving the impression of an ongoing hunt. *For singing events and fake hunt events, all doors in the room where the target player is will close (including exit doors, but without locking them), and the lights in that room will also turn off. **The fake hunt without vocalisations does not close doors and will end prematurely if the player turns on a light or leaves the room the event started in. *Light switches cannot be toggled in the room where the ghost event occurs if the lights will shatter at the end of the event. *Ghosts will not leave fingerprints on doors being closed and lights being turned off by the event. The ghost event will end prematurely if the ghost goes near enough to the target player, making it disappear. ====Mist Form==== The ghost will turn off all lights in the target player's room and cause a small white cloud to appear in the room. The cloud will then begin floating toward the player, and if it reaches them it will disappear, and cause a sharp hissing sound, in which the pitch and duration is always the same. If the player keeps their distance from it long enough, it will eventually vanish without hissing (or draining any sanity). This event goes by multiple names, such as \"airball\", \"smoke ball\", or simply \"mist\". Note that there are other \"mist\"-like things or graphics effects that can all be confused with each other, such as freezing breath, incense smoke, or lighting bloom. ====Summoning==== This event can be triggered by using a Summoning Circle or the Monkey Paw's \"I wish to see the ghost\" wish. When used, the ghost will be teleported to the circle (or stay at its current location instead when using the Monkey Paw), become visible and remain trapped there for 5 seconds. Afterwards, it will begin a cursed hunt on the spot. ====Music Box==== This event can only be triggered by using a Music Box. If the ghost is within 5 metres (2.5 metres for Yokai) of an actively playing music box, it will become visible and begin walking towards the box. If it walks for 5 seconds, touches a player holding the music box, or the music box is dropped, it will begin a cursed hunt. ===Sanity drain=== If the ghost event target collides with the ghost or the mist form, causing it to disappear, 10% of their sanity will be deducted. For light-shattering events, the player has to be near the ghost when the event ends. Some ghosts have differing rates of sanity drain: *Banshee: 15% sanity instead of 10% if: **The ghost event is of the singing type, and **The ghost event target is also the hunt target. *Oni: double sanity drain for all types of events. *Phantom: Additional 0.5%/s sanity drain if the player is within 10 metres of the ghost while in pseudo line-of-sight (where heartbeats play). ===Ghost event rates and preferences=== Some ghosts have a preference for certain types of ghost events, or have modified rates of ghost events: *Banshee: Higher chance of singing ghost events. *Mare: Higher chance of light-shattering ghost events. *Oni: Will never perform the mist form ghost event, and is more likely to appear in its full form when manifesting. *Shade: Higher chance of shadow model for manifestation events, and increasing sanity (above 50%) corresponds to decreasing chance of ghost events overall. **Also has a chance of showing up as a shadow model when summoned via the summoning circle, the music box, or the monkey paw, for the duration of the ghost event. *Thaye: Initially 100% more likely to perform ghost events. Every time it ages, the likelihood decreases by 15% in absolute terms, decreasing to 50% once it has aged completely. {| class=\"mw-collapsible mw-collapsed fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"9\" |Advanced mechanics |- ! colspan=\"9\" |WARNING: This data is not officially verified. |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |Ghost ! rowspan=\"2\" |Singing ! colspan=\"3\" |Standing ! rowspan=\"2\" |Chasing ! rowspan=\"2\" |Mist Form ! rowspan=\"2\" |Chasing without vocalizations |- !Standard !Light-breaking !Red light |- |Standard |20% (1/5) |6.67% (1/15) |6.67% (1/15) |6.67% (1/15) |20% (1/5) |20% (1/5) |20% (1/5) |- |Banshee |46.67% (7/15) |6.67% (1/15) |6.67% (1/15) |6.67% (1/15) |20% (1/5) |20% (1/5) |20% (1/5) |- |Mare |20% (1/5) |4.44% (2/45) |11.11% (1/9) |4.44% (2/45) |20% (1/5) |20% (1/5) |20% (1/5) |- |Oni |20% (1/5) |6.67% (1/15) |6.67% (1/15) |6.67% (1/15) |40% (2/5) |0% |20% (1/5) |- |Shade |0% |6.67% (1/15) |6.67% (1/15) |6.67% (1/15) |20% (1/5) |60% (3/5) |0% |} ===Non-ghost events=== The following are not considered ghost events: *A hunt or a cursed hunt. *Any ghost activity occurring during a hunt. *Room lighting fading or dimming for 1-2 seconds. *Firelights burning out by themselves. *Any interaction. *The Yurei's ability to shut a door and deduct nearby players' sanity. ==Tips== *Although smudging is not known to directly increase the chance of a ghost event, doing so when sanity is very low may allow the ghost to perform a ghost event instead of hunting. ==Related difficulty settings== *Event frequency: The chance for the ghost to trigger an event ==Objectives== {| class=\"article-table\" !Objective !Actual requirements |- |Have a member of your team witness a Ghost Event |Have a ghost event occur |} ==Trivia== *Doors being closed during a ghost event will create a photographable EMF 2 or 5 interaction. ==References== Category:Ghost State fr:Événement paranormal ru:Паранормальное явление","title":"Ghost Event","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Ghost_Event"}
{"content":"The Infrared Light Sensor was an item that helped to indicate the ghost's physical location. It was removed in 0.3.0. ==Usage== When a player, dead player or ghost walked past the infrared light sensor, it would illuminate the surrounding area with a bright light, allowing players to track the ghost to a certain degree while on-site. The Infrared Light Sensor did not provide feedback to the truck, nor did it count for the \"Detect the ghost with a motion sensor\" objective. Due to its very limited utility, it was merged with the Motion Sensor. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access Alpha |- !August 13, 2020 |Added the Infrared Light Sensor as an equipment. |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access (Steam) |- !0.3.0 |Removed the Infrared Light Sensor. |}<br> Category:Equipment fr:Capteur à lumière infrarouge ru:Инфракрасный датчик света","title":"Infrared Light Sensor","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Infrared_Light_Sensor"}
{"content":"The lobby, or warehouse, is the place players will spawn upon starting up the game or finishing a contract. It is a warehouse that has been converted into the lobby. The lobby is used as an intermission area for players to find or create servers, play minigames while waiting, purchase equipment, or simply to interact with other players. ==Layout== The lobby contains several distinct areas, which are, clock-wise: ===Main menu board=== This is where players will spawn upon launching the game/joining the lobby. This board acts as a user interface and contains several options. To access the board, the player must press Space or left-click on it; it is not necessary to be in front of the board if pressing space. Players can press Space again or the Esc key to leave the board. ====Main menu==== This is the menu which will appear before joining a lobby. From there, players may either create or join lobbies as well as view their daily and weekly objectives progression. * Singleplayer - create a singleplayer session * Multiplayer - create or join a server * Training - learn the basics of ghost hunting * Twitch Drops - link your Twitch account to the game * Options - adjust the settings to your preference * Credits - Shows a list of people who directly contributed to the game's development * Quit - exit to desktop ====Lobby menu==== This menu appears upon joining a lobby. It allows the host and other players to adjust server settings and manage players before starting a game. Every player in the lobby will appear as ID Cards on the board. The host is able to kick players from the lobby using the \"X\" button next to the player's card, whom will be barred to join again until the host leaves. All players can also adjust the volume of other players for themselves using the scroll bar at the bottom of the player's card. If the lobby is set to \"private\" upon creation, a code will be assigned to it, which will be displayed in the top right corner. Players are able to copy the lobby code to share it to others or hide it from view (this will not hide it for other players in the lobby; this feature is meant for streamers to prevent viewers from joining the lobby). The server settings can be managed through these buttons: * Change - Allows the host to change the difficulty or create a custom difficulty (see below). Non-hosts can view the current difficulty through this button. * Leave - Disconnects the player from the lobby * Ready - Marks the player as \"ready\" to start the game. Every player in the lobby must be ready for the host to start the game. * Start (Host) - Starts the game. ====Difficulty selection==== By clicking on the pen icon by the difficulty box, players will be able to view and edit the current difficulty through the \"change\" button. Alongside the five default difficulties and the Challenge Mode, there are three custom difficulty preset slots players may edit in order to create unique gameplay experiences. ===Shop=== This is where players can buy or sell equipment as well as add them to the game through a large touch-screen. Players may also create custom loadouts they may select upon entering a lobby. The area is also decorated with display cases and two large wall racks containing all equipment. ===Display area=== This area consist of several display cases where collectibles and items found during investigations will appear, including: *Bones (certain bones such as hands, feet, femurs, etc. must be collected twice) *Cursed possessions used during investigations (Tarot Cards are collected individually by drawing them from the deck) *Trophies related to special events. *Trophies related to Achievements/Trophies. Clicking on items inside the display cases will allow the player to inspect them closer. ===Entertainment corner=== Going up the stairs, there is a mezzanine where several games and entertainments can be found. ====Basketball==== There is a basketball hoop on one of the walls as well as two basketballs on a table in a corner. The hoop is equipped with a score display that will count the number of goals a player has made. The number of goals is specific to each player; one player scoring a goal will not increase the score of other players and the number of goals will carry over from one server to another. ====Cornhole and ring toss==== Sets of cornhole and ring toss games. The rings and bags for each game can be found on the same table as the basketballs. ====Bowling==== There are pins disposed on the floor along with a small bowling ball players may toss. The pins can be similarily to firelights. ====Jenga==== A stack of jenga blocks (branded \"Biggish Blocks\") where players may play jenga. Each jenga block can be in a manner similar to Video Cameras. ===Staff room=== A dark, inaccessible room located under the entertainment corner. By peering through the window, the Patient 07 ghost model can be seen twitching at the far end of the room. ===Event board/Boombox=== There is a table next to the staff room where the Event Board, a boombox, and two clipboards displaying the Daily and Weekly Tasks can be found. The boombox can be toggled on or off to play techno music for the player that has activated it. It may also play themed music or start on during special events. The music titles played by the boombox are: *Rik4k - All Aboard *Rik4k - Back in Time *Rik4k - Dreaming Emotion *Rik4k - Enlight *Rik4k - Forgotten Truth *Rik4k - Luminosity *Rik4k - Peace Circus *Rik4k - Promotion *Rik4k - Rocket Science *Rik4k - Summer Ending ===Truck=== The players may access and explore the truck from this area. The corkboard inside displays the 10 last pictures taken during a game. ===Event leaderboard=== Only available during special events, a leaderboard displaying the Top 10 players having contributed to the current event, and the player's own rank and points. ===Map selection board=== On the left of the main menu board, there is another corkboard where players can choose the next map to play on. This is a vote-based system; the map with the majority of votes will be the one chosen for the contract. If multiple maps have the same number of votes, the game will randomly choose between the tied maps upon starting the contract. The players may also choose the \"random\" option to let the game select the map for them. ==Events== On multiple occasions, the lobby has been decorated to celebrate various special events: ===Halloween 2020=== During this event, the lobby was decorated with Jack-o-lanterns, the lights were dimmed out. and particles resembling Ghost Orbs were floating near the board. The sky outside was also turned bright red. ===1st Year Anniversary=== The lobby was decorated with various party accessories, including banners, party lights, interactible balloons scattered on the floor, as well as Glowsticks of different colors players could pick up. Player models were also given party hats that they would keep for the entire game while the event was ongoing. It is also during this event that the boombox was introduced. ===Halloween 2021=== Most of the lights in the lobby were turned off, the sky turned an ominous bright red and particles resembling ember floated around the white board, giving the lobby a very sinister ambience. UV flashlights were disposed under the white board, which could be used to reveal various messages and writings all over the walls and floor. Some special elements were are also added: *The door by the electrical board is slightly ajar. Peering through will make the ring girl ghost model suddenly appear in the gap with a loud hissing sound. *A shadowy child ghost model with bright glowing eyes is peering down at players from the rafters above the white board. This is modified from the \"tooth-faced\" ghost model. *There is a skeleton hidden in one of the lockers. Player models also wore paper masks representing various ghost models for the entirety of the event. After the event ended, the lighting and particle effects were removed, but the UV messages and other physical decorations remained. One UV flashlight stayed available on the equipment shelf for use. ===Holiday 2021=== The lobby gained a Christmas tree with several presents surrounding it, two minigames for players to spend time on, snowballs to throw, and snow covering part of the floor. Player models wore elf hats for the duration of the event; additionally, one of the ghost models was temporarily changed to wear a Santa hat, wield an oversized candy cane instead of an axe, and ring jingle bells every time it made an audible step. ===Halloween 2022=== The lobby received ominous lighting effects as well as various thematic props, such as skeletons, candelabras and jack o' lanterns. The jack o' lanterns could be lit using a lighter found on the table where the boombox is. A then-upcoming Tier III UV Light could be picked up from a box behind the counter of the shop area and used to reveal various writings on the wall. Peering through the Staff Room door at the ghost model inside would cause a demonic circle to appear in the middle of the lobby with ominous grandfather clock sound effects, surrounded by five sheet-covered ghosts (these are merely accessory NPCs, not to be confused with actual ghosts) who would whisper and emit freezing breath. If the player walked into the middle of the circle, the ghosts would start to slowly close in with a rising sound effect, until they all suddenly dematerialize, leaving the sheets dropping to the ground and finishing the event. ===Holiday 2022=== Between 0.8.0 and 0.8.0.7, the lobby featured several decorations: * Christmas fairy lights and bells * Stockings hung on the walls * 3 snowmen who turn their heads to look at the player * A cookie plate on the table * Christmas-themed music (using the same music as 2021) ===Halloween 2023=== The lobby was very similar to the Halloween 2022 lobby with the same thematic decorations minus the lighters and the Tier III UV Light. The demonic circle event was also present. ===Holiday 2023=== The lobby received several themed decorations: * Christmas fairy lights * Stockings hung on the walls * 4 snowmen * A cookie plate on the table * Snowballs * Presents * Christmas-themed music (using the same music as 2021) ===Easter 2024=== The lobby received several themed decorations: * A Summoning Ritual * Twigs * Bunnies * Fireflies * Nests with eggs ===Crimson Eye=== During the Crimson Eye event, the lobby received Halloween-themed decorations: * A Blood Altar * Candles * Demonic symbols * Halloween-themed music ===Winter's Jest=== During the Winter's Jest event, the lobby received Christmas-themed decorations: * A Christmas tree * Snow * Presents * Christmas-themed music ===Cursed Hollow=== During the Cursed Hollow event, the lobby received Easter-themed decorations: * Straw * Wooden bunnies * Fireflies * Ominous whispers on the boombox ===5th Year Anniversary=== In 0.14.1.0, as Phasmophobia celebrated its 5th anniversary, decorations such as balloons, fanions, confetti, usable confetti poppers, and an anniversary cake were added to the lobby. ==Trivia== *The lobby that came with the initial Steam release of Phasmophobia was a modified version of the Garage Workshop pre-made Unity asset. Many elements from this pack were also used in other areas of the game, such as the lockers and clutter like crates or bins found across some of the pre-Apocalypse update maps. *Shooting 666 hoops will trigger lighting and thunder outside. *Between 0.3.0 and 0.3.1.2, old equipment models could be found in a cardboard box on a shelf on the right of the whiteboard. *Two rings from the ring toss can be linked together by throwing the first one upwards and collide it with the second one by the same way. This is most likely a Unity physics bug. *An engraving on the side of the table with a boombox reads JOJO WAS HERE. This is a reference to an official Phasmophobia content creator, JOJOsaysBREE. *Several runes could be found in the display area using a UV Light between 0.8.1.0 and 0.10.0. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !0.7.0 |Updated the lobby. |- !0.10.0 |Removed Point Hope teasers. |- !0.11.0 |Added the Event Board. |- !0.11.1.1 |Added the Event Leaderboard. |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |0.13.0 |Added trophies to the display area. |- |Reworked the main menu board. |} ==References== Category:Maps fr:Lobby","title":"Lobby","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Lobby"}
{"content":"This guide demonstrates how to survive a ghost's hunting phase in Phasmophobia, as well as necessary information to do so. During regular gameplay, and not taking into account the use of certain cursed possessions, the hunt is the only mechanic in which a ghost can kill players one at a time by colliding with them. No items can end a hunt, although lit Incense can disorient ghosts for some time. Thus, in order to survive, players are required to either hide from, try to outrun, or loop the ghost for as long as they can until the hunt ends. ==Identifying the start of a hunt== Hunts are not always easy to tell apart from other manifestation ghost events (especially by newer players). The following is a list of indicators that are unique to hunts, manifestation ghost events, or shared between both: {| class=\"fandom-table\" !Indicator !Hunt !Event (manifestation) |- |Exit Doors |Will audibly and physically lock and/or close, depending on whether the door was (re)opened prior |May close (not lock) for singing/chasing event that occurs in the same room as said exit door |- |Doors |No interaction |Singing/chasing event: All doors in the room where the event occured will close<br>All other events: No interaction |- |Lights |Will stay in same position and cannot be toggled until hunt ends<br />Will dim or flicker on ghost approach<br />Will immediately turn off as the hunt ends |Will either turn off at the start of the event, or have a small chance to either turn red, or shatter then break as the event ends<br />Cannot be toggled in the room where the event occured (only red-light/light shattering events)<br />Can be toggled in all rooms for all other events |- |Ghost Model appearance |Always full model |May appear as a full model, shadow, or semi-transparent |- |Model phasing (blinking) |Will be invisible during the grace period, then start phasing as it hunts |Will immediately and always be visible for the duration of the event, and never phase |- |Speed |Will move at several various speeds depending on its type and situation; see Hunt#Ghost speeds |Either remain stationary, or chase a player at 1.7 m/s for a short while before disappearing (chasing duration may vary) |- |Footsteps |Always heard upon beginning to move |Only heard for chasing events |- |Vocalisations |Same vocalisation for every hunt in the same contract |In addition to any regular vocalisations, female ghosts can use \"Ring Around the Rosie\" tune while male can produce a low-tone two notes during singing events |- |Electronic interference/global chat static | colspan=\"2\" |Will flicker within 10 metres of the ghost (15 metres for Raiju) on the same floor |- |Heartbeats | colspan=\"2\" |Plays within 10 metres of the ghost and having \"heartbeat line-of-sight (LoS)\" |}<br>Keep in mind that unless a cursed hunt is initiated, ghosts cannot hunt for a certain duration (90 seconds for most ghosts) after being smudged. ==Surviving a hunt== There are many strategies for surviving a hunt. Some of these may involve riskier tactics, while others may require cooperation between players. Often, using multiple strategies will help to achieve the highest chance of survival. ===Knowing the map's layout=== It is ideal to get a good sense of the layout of all maps, including good hiding places, potential dead-ends, and routes for you to escape. Map layouts range from the near-symmetry of Brownstone High School and Sunny Meadows, to the organic layout of Maple Lodge Campsite, to the tighter environments of 42 Edgefield Road and 6 Tanglewood Drive. Knowing the symmetry of the map may improve your understanding of the layout. ===Hunt prevention=== Preventing hunts from occurring in the first place is a very dependable way to reduce the risk of dying. ;Incense *Smudging the ghost will prevent hunts for the next 90 seconds (60 seconds for Demon and 180 seconds for Spirit). This applies even when the ghost is smudged during a hunt, though the ongoing hunt will not end. It may be preferable to smudge just as a hunt is about to end (if you are far away from the favorite room), or just before the hunt cooldown is over. *Note that if an existing hunt prevention cooldown from a previous Incense is still ongoing, using a new Incense will not restart the timer. ;Crucifix *In some cases, it may be more ideal to place a crucifix along the escape route near the favorite room, so that the ghost does not initiate a hunt from there. Make use of the visible crucifix radius to cover a larger area. ;Sanity *If you start with 100% sanity, almost all ghosts cannot hunt immediately unless you use a cursed possession. By turning on lights, holding lit candles, avoiding ghost events, and taking Sanity Pills as needed, you can keep sanity well above the threshold for most ghosts for a longer time. If you start at lower sanity, these strategies may decrease in usefulness. Though hunts are dangerous, in some cases it may be necessary for them to happen for the players to identify the ghost or complete objectives. ===Communicating hunts=== When a hunt starts, there is usually a short grace period before the ghost can actually detect or kill players. Communicating to other players that a hunt has started can help them to get a head start on the ghost and be more likely to survive. As players that are far enough from the ghost can still use global chat, they can communicate that a hunt has started if they realize so. Some clues include all the exit doors locking, the activity level displayed in the truck reaching 10, and light switches becoming unusable. Note that some of these may also be caused by ghost events or other factors. ===Running away=== Once a hunt starts, try to figure out where exactly the ghost will spawn. The only indicators of where the ghost will be are electronic interference and its hunting noise, so a stereo audio setup is recommended. Depending on where the ghost begins, decide which hiding spots are feasible and begin to move. *Try not to hide near the area where the ghost could spawn; otherwise, hiding near the ghost could mean it detecting you quickly, then looking around your last seen location first. However, if you can reach a decent hiding spot before the ghost can detect players, then don't be afraid to hide near the ghost; as long as you are hidden in time, it does not matter whether the ghost is nearby or far away. *If the ghost spawns just outside the room you're in, try to get to the safest spot against an adjacent wall, so your line of sight can be broken by at least another corner. *Use the sprint ability strategically, as it will only allow the player to run for 3 seconds before having a 5 second cooldown, limiting the player to walking. It can either be used whenever a hunt starts to gain a head start on the ghost to quickly reach a hiding location or to quickly break line of sight if the ghost happens to spot the player. *Most ghosts speed up with continued line-of-sight. Hence, refrain from running in a straight line from the ghost; use corners or objects to your advantage instead. If you happen to run into a long hallway or a corridor, always consider pointers to break line of sight such as doors or stairs. Generally, using two line-of-sight blockers in quick succession (e.g. by turning corners and closing doors) before entering a hiding spot is a great way to shake off the ghost effectively. *Once you know the route, turn off your electronic equipment as soon as possible. Having lit firelights, igniters, or Tier II UV lights does not attract the ghost and can safely be used in case you still need to see. *If the ghost had the chance to spot you or a teammate, it will \"camp\" around that location for a little, before moving to a new random area. Make sure you are always moving towards the hiding spot and be very attentive to its hunting sounds. The Myling's vocalizations are audible only from a shorter distance, while some vocalizations can be very soft. *Some ghosts (e.g. Revenant, Hantu) have different speed abilities that may allow them to catch up even quicker. This is important to note if the ghost's location is relatively free of obstructions, making it harder to break line-of-sight with the ghost and enabling it to continue chasing at high speeds. ===Hiding=== While searching for the ghost or afterwards, players should identify accessible hiding spots around the map. Hiding spots may sometimes be inaccessible, forcing players to take potentially riskier routes to escape the ghost during a hunt. Note that some object/furniture hiding spots are not \"official\" hiding spots, and hence will never be blocked off. In addition, there may be certain locations which may act as decent hiding spots, even without furniture. So there are usually more \"hiding spots\" available than listed, depending on the risk you can take. If the ghost is a Deogen, however, hiding is pointless and may cause the player to get cornered and killed as it always knows where all players are during a hunt. ;Official hiding spots Players should prioritize official hiding spots such as closets, lockers, small tents, etc., as these are usually the safest spots. ;Furniture Generally, recommended hiding spots based on furniture can often be located in a dead end, such that the ghost will rarely path all the way to that area, and the only line-of-sight to the player is from the area right beside the hiding spot. As a general rule of thumb, if the furniture covers the player to at least the horizontal eye level, it should be a viable hiding spot. Players may need to crouch where the furniture is not tall enough to fully cover them otherwise (e.g. kitchen tables/islands). Generally, furniture elements with no or small collision hitboxes such as potted plants or the bushes on Maple Lodge Campsite will not hide the player from the ghost. ;Room If all else fails, simply hiding in a room is the last resort. It is best to choose smaller and dead-end rooms. The pathable area is small, meaning that the ghost is less likely to choose that room to enter. On smaller maps, this is risky as the ghost simply has to walk into the room you're hiding in to kill you. This strategy is marginally more useful on larger maps, such as Sunny Meadows; The vast number of rooms and area the ghost can choose to cover creates a significantly smaller chance for it to find you. As the ghost can detect nearby players hiding behind open doors, you must remember to close the door if you are hiding in a small room. ;Glitched spots Some maps have spots where it is impossible for the ghost to kill a player, even when the ghost is fully aware of the player being there. This generally occurs in places where the ghost is either unable to collide with the player, or cannot achieve line-of-sight. Some of these spots may require additional actions by the player to remain safe. Users of these spots should take note that they can be patched in any update, and cannot be relied on indefinitely. ===Being far away=== On the largest maps such as Sunny Meadows and Brownstone High School, simply staying far enough away from the ghost is a relatively safe way to avoid death. In the same vein that a ghost is extremely unlikely to wander to a faraway location by chance, it will also tend to wander relatively near its starting location (e.g. in a wing of Sunny Meadows) during a hunt, and is unlikely to find players in an extremely far location as long as the latter are somewhat hidden and cannot be spotted from afar. In extreme cases, it may even be possible for an entire hunt to start and end without players realizing a hunt had even occurred. ===Lighting Incense near the ghost=== Using Incense near a ghost will cause it to ignore all players for 5 seconds. This gives the player time to escape and move to a different location to hide if needed. Beware that the ghost can still wander in the same direction as an escaping player, making it lock back onto them if it can see them. *Preferably, you should be able to reach a hiding spot by the time the Incense runs out. Avoid sprinting before you have even lit the Incense to keep the sprint for later. *Remember that each Incense can only be used once and will only blind the ghost once. Trying to light it again won't work and keeping it in your hand after it has burnt out is pointless. *The Moroi is smudged for 7.5 seconds instead of 5, giving players more time to move to a hiding spot. *If you are not the host of the current lobby or have a slow connection, try to light the Incense slightly earlier than you comfortably would, as significant lag on the player's end may cause the ghost to be registered as killing them before the Incense is actually lit. As long as the Incense is burned near the ghost, its effects will be applied regardless of the player who burned it, allowing players to effectively save each other. For example, if a player is hiding and another player is chased by a ghost nearby, the hidden player can light an Incense to disorient the ghost, and allow the escaping player to hide in the hiding spot without compromising it. ===Looping the ghost=== Some locations have furniture or walls that are located in such a way that players can loop around while the ghost is chasing them, such as Grafton Farmhouse, where one can loop between the Dining Room, the Kitchen, and the Foyer, or around the kitchen islands in various houses. Looping takes advantage of the shape of the furniture or structure continually breaking line-of-sight, reducing the ghost's acceleration. Generally, most looping is done around kitchen islands, and players usually crouch to slow the rate at which the ghost gains speed. Players looking for more intense gameplay may loop the ghost until the end of the hunt, but partial looping can also be used to run to a safer place or bide time. Looping can also be used to save other players, especially in Nightmare and Insanity difficulty if the ghost is chasing players towards a dead end. If the player plans on looping, keep the lights in the room turned on to aid visibility. Looping will generally involve the ghost reversing direction; players should keep a lookout for when it does so. Looping is generally more dangerous if the ghost is a Phantom, has a speed advantage, or is a crawling ghost, and players may need to listen for the ghost's precise location or abandon looping altogether. If the player performing the strategy is confident, they may try to take pictures of the ghost while looping, though this usually requires the player to continually have line-of-sight with the ghost, making it accelerate. Crouching while looping the ghost can drastically reduce its time with line-of-sight to you, therefor also drastically reducing how quickly it accelerates. An Incense is highly recommended in case the ghost catches up with the player. *The Deogen, Hantu and Thaye become slower than even the player's walking speed under certain conditions, and do not speed up with line-of-sight; looping these ghosts is generally much safer, and in the case of the Deogen, is essential for surviving against it. Tier III Salt may come particularly handy to loop a ghost, since it has the ability to slow down a hunting ghost for 2 seconds (this will not reset the line of sight acceleration, however). Placing lines at regular intervals may allow the player to loop a ghost for possibly the entire hunt. ===Turning off, throwing, and/or swapping electronic equipment=== As any active electronic equipment held in the hand, including flashlights (even when on the shoulder), will attract the ghost within 7.5 meters, players should turn these off or swap them to another inventory slot before entering their hiding place, or preferably as early into the hunt as possible. Note that the default flashlight with a very weak light (that cannot be removed from the shoulder) will not attract the ghost. *Ghosts will move to the last known location of a detected electronic, even if it was turned off after. Do not turn off electronics in the hiding spot - do so well before entering the spot. *In particular, any worn Head Gear should be turned off as soon as possible, as they require a short moment of holding the Special key to turn off, so if the ghost wanders nearby, it may already be too late. *Always assume that attracting the ghost is instantaneous; electronic equipment that is turned on then very quickly turned off can still be detected if the ghost is within range. *For the Yokai, this range is 2.5 metres. A Raiju will gain speed almost equal to that of a Revenant if nearby electronic equipment is active, even when thrown on the floor, so swapping electronics into the inventory, or turning them off before throwing them, is important to prevent it from gaining strength. ===Staying quiet=== The ghost is able to hear players using any form of voice chat within 9 meters; a ghost which hears a player will immediately go to their location and attempt to kill them if they are present. For the Yokai, this range is also 2.5 meters. On smaller maps, it is especially important to keep quiet, as the ghost will more often be within range to hear you if you speak. Using push-to-talk can be useful if one has sufficient background noise that may inadvertently alert the ghost. If your cat's meow is loud enough, the ghost knows! ==Recognizing the end of a hunt== When a hunt ends, the ghost will disappear and be teleported back to its room, hunting sounds will cease, and all lights will turn off and be toggleable again. If hiding away from the ghost, try toggling a light source to see if it turns on, audibly clicks, or physically changes (e.g. light switches flicking up and down). If the player is near an exit door, they may also try opening it; successfully opening an exit door means the hunt is over. If a player kill ends the hunt, hearing a player die also means that the hunt has ended, however unfortunate this may be. ==Other tips== *Listen for vocalizations and footsteps that the ghost makes to determine its location. Similarly, all electronic equipment can give players a general idea of the ghost's whereabouts during a hunt. **Keeping exit doors open provides an good indicator for a hunt starting, due to the obvious closing and locking sound the door makes upon a hunt start. *Whether a player is standing or crouching, they will walk and sprint at the same speed. The same is true whether the player is running forwards or backwards, left or right, or even running backwards while crouched. Crouching can be useful for wayfinding in the dark. *In theory, if all players manage to get outside of the investigation area during a hunt, the hunt will end prematurely. **The only legitimate method of doing so is by using the Monkey Paw. The paw can be used to unlock all exit doors even during a hunt (or if they were locked due to another reason).

{"content":"This guide will teach you how to identify ghosts in Phasmophobia. ==Using evidences== The standard way of identifying a ghost is by collecting evidence. The list below presents a brief overview on how to collect evidences; more information may be found in their respective pages. ===D.O.T.S Projector=== A silhouette will appear when the ghost enters a \"D.O.T.S state\". Do not mistake your own breath for D.O.T.S. ===EMF Level 5=== When the ghost interacts with a door or object, take an EMF reader and check for any EMF level 5 readings at that spot. If the ghost has EMF Level 5 as one of its evidences, there is a 25% chance for that interaction to show level 5 instead of level 2 or 3. You can also use a Ouija Board to check for EMF level 5 by repeatedly asking questions with a reader nearby. Note that electronic interference during hunts or ghost events will never result in a reading of level 5, though it can be obtained if the ghost leaves EMF 5 on an object and moves far enough during a hunt. ===Ultraviolet=== When a ghost interacts with a door, light switch, or window, take a UV Light and shine it around the object it interacted with. On some maps, the ghost can leave fingerprints on many more objects, including string light poles, cooler boxes, tent windows, and more. Be aware that each fingerprint will only last 2 minutes (or 1 minute on Insanity difficulty) before disappearing, and some could last for much shorter if the ghost is an Obake. Alternatively, the ghost can leave footprints behind after stepping in salt. Take heed that the ghost may leave no footprint if it decides to stop moving after stepping in salt. ===Freezing Temperatures=== Freezing Temperatures can be confirmed using the thermometer with a reading of or less. It is recommended to wait for the reading to go below on a Tier I thermometer due to its inaccuracy. The player's cold breath does not count as Freezing Temperatures. ===Ghost Orb=== Ghost Orbs can be viewed via video cameras and appear as a small dot that glides around slowly, flashing in and out of existence. Unless the ghost room changes on higher difficulties, they will remain in the same room, but will move around the room from time to time. Take care in observing them in snow or foggy weather; snow will never go upwards while Ghost Orbs may move in any direction, while fog may make it harder to see. ===Ghost Writing=== Ghost Writing works similar to the D.O.T.S. Projector in that the player simply waits for it appear. However, Ghost Writing can take a much longer time to appear than the D.O.T.S. Projector silhouette. Removing all others props in the room (excluding player equipment) may help to increase the chance of the ghost choosing the book to interact with. ===Spirit Box=== When asking questions using the Spirit Box, ensure that the lights are off in the room, have only the questioner in the room if the ghost is stated to respond only to people who are alone (or on Professional difficulties and higher), and ask multiple times per room to improve accuracy. The ghost must be within the Spirit Box's range. Doing this only after the ghost has been located is usually less tedious. Motion Sensors can help pinpointing the ghost's exact location. ==Using traits== If the ghost refuses to give certain evidence, and when some pieces of evidence are hidden, observing the ghost's abilities and traits may be advantageous in finding out the ghost type. Certain ghosts will exhibit traits and behavior exclusive to their type, such as Mares interacting with lights more often, or Onis being more active and causing more ghost events. However, some of these traits are also subject to the game's random nature, and may or may not manifest itself because of this. ===General tips=== On Nightmare difficulty, after having obtained two pieces of evidence, it is generally best practice to compare the \"tests\" that can be performed, and first conduct those that are more objective, or easier to observe. For example, when given a choice between Mare and Revenant, it is usually easier to check the ghost's speed during a hunt, as the Revenant's slow wander or fast chase speed can identify it immediately, instead of looking for abilities from the Mare like instant light-switching or light-shattering ghost events, as these are more prone to error due to the game's random nature. In addition, certain behaviours that the ghost exhibits any time in the contract may allow for instant identification or elimination, such as the Obake's six-fingered handprints or the Oni's inability to produce a smoke ball ghost event. Since the rate of ghost footsteps is tied to its speed, listening to the rate of footsteps will be useful in eliminating or confirming ghosts. ===Narrowing ghosts to one with specific traits=== The following section is for ways to identify ghosts via specific traits and behaviours. A list of mechanics of each ghost can be found in their respective pages. {| class=\"fandom-table\" |+An evidence icon below the ghost's name (e.g. Deogen ) means that the evidence is guaranteed for that ghost. This means that on difficulties with 1/2 evidence (e.g. Nightmare), that one of those 1/2 evidences will always be the guaranteed evidence for that ghost. If you do not obtain that evidence, then you can eliminate that ghost as a possibility. This does not apply on 0-evidence difficulties. !Ghost !Tests, unique identifiers, or anti-tells !Other possible identifiers |- !Banshee | *Will target a single player, ignoring all other players **If target is outside building/investigation area, will hunt normally (i.e. can chase and kill other players) **Test: During a hunt, have all players hidden inside the building, then let one player attempt to bait the ghost through line-of-sight (LoS) (e.g., by looping); if the ghost ignores the player, then it is a Banshee. If the player is chased, repeat with another player. *Chance of emitting a shriek-like sound via Parabolic Microphone (33% to replace a whisper) *Will never change favourite room; the ghost doing so (having confirmed by Haunted Mirror or other means) eliminates Banshee **Never changing favourite room could be (but not definitely) a Banshee; the larger the room is, the less likely the ghost is to change rooms | *More likely to perform singing ghost events *Frequently wanders away from favourite room to target; use motion sensors to check. Seeing ghost activity far away from the favourite room (especially on larger maps) could indicate a Phantom/Wraith/Banshee/The Twins, but this will be more common with Banshee *Hunts based solely on target's sanity (even if outside); no hunts despite low average sanity but with one high-sanity player may indicate them as target, and vice versa |- !Demon | *Minimum hunt cooldown of 20 seconds, instead of standard 25 seconds (excluding cursed hunts) **Test: If it hunts before 25 seconds, it is a Demon. Hunting 25 seconds or later does not exclude Demon *Hunt sanity threshold of 70%, with rare chance to hunt at any sanity | *Smudging prevents regular hunts for next 60 seconds, instead of standard 90 seconds **Test: If it hunts within 60 - 89 seconds, it is probably a Demon; hunting only after 90 seconds does not exclude Demon **Take care to not use Incense when the ghost is standing on stairs, as this can cause the cleansing effect to miss - hunting before 60 seconds means that the ghost was not actually cleansed *Effective crucifix range is 50% larger **Having a lazily placed crucifix burn when the ghost would normally not have used it may indicate a Demon, though ghosts could happen to wander away from their room into the crucifix's range **A crucifix being used while still on the truck wall on 42 Edgefield Road is almost certainly a Demon (usually in the garage or master bedroom) |- !Deogen<br> | *Always knows the location of all players, and speed is based on distance to currently targeted player (3 m/s when further than 6 metres, 0.4 m/s when closer than 2.5 metres) **Test: During a hunt, stay near or in a hiding spot, and listen for the ghost running quickly to a player and slowing down massively as it approaches **The Thaye has a similar speed to a Deogen far away when young; prepare an Incense in case it is not a Deogen *When using the Spirit Box within 1 metre of the Deogen, 33% chance per question to produce loud, deep breathing instead of a regular response **Set up motion sensors to accurately track the ghost's location, and use the spirit box near it **Ghost event/hunt vocalisations do not count | *Hunt sanity threshold of 40% |- !Goryo<br> | *D.O.T.S Projector silhouette only visible through a video camera, and while no players are in the ghost's current room **Seeing the silhouette without a video camera eliminates Goryo **Not based on where the D.O.T.S Projector or favourite room is; if you are in the favourite room and the Goryo roams out, you could still see the silhouette **Ghost events and hunts are not affected by this ability *Will never change favourite room; the ghost doing so (having confirmed by Haunted Mirror or other means) eliminates Goryo **Never changing favourite room could be (but not definitely) a Goryo; the larger the room is, the less likely the ghost is to change rooms | *Cannot perform long roams; ghost activity being relatively confined to favourite room and immediate vicinity (excluding ghost events and hunts) could indicate a Goryo |- !Hantu<br> | *Speed based on room's current temperature and will not speed up on line-of-sight: slowest at 1.4 m/s when above , fastest at 2.7 m/s below **Test: Listen for hunt speed; if it is very fast in a cold room (favourite room is usually but not always cold) but slower in warm rooms, then it is probably a Hantu. Alternatively, turn the fuse box off, then listen for its footsteps over several hunts *Will never turn on the fuse box; a ghost doing so eliminates Hantu *Will emit freezing breath during a hunt if fuse box is turned off | *Twice as likely to turn off the fuse box relative to other ghosts |- !Jinn | *Speed fixed at 2.5 m/s if three conditions are met: fuse box is on, Jinn is chasing player, and the player is further than 3 metres. Otherwise, chases at standard ghost speed **Test: Stand at the end of a long hallway or room, then wait for ghost to appear at the other end. If its speed increases instantly and not over a period of time, then it is a Jinn **Unlike Revenant, has normal speed when not chasing a player, and ability is not based on hearing player or detecting electronics *Occasionally, decreases sanity of a player in same room or within 3 metres by 25%, giving an EMF reading at the fuse box **Test: Place EMF Reader on fuse box. If it rings without anything else happening, then it is likely the Jinn's ability. Note that the fuse box turning on or its door moving is not indicative. Depending on where EMF is placed, it could also be another ghost using its own ability while standing near the fuse box *Will never turn off fuse box directly, but can still overload it if too many lights are turned on (set limit based on map size) | *Fuse box never being turned off after a long time could mean (but not definitely) a Jinn |- !Mare | *Will never turn individual lights on; a ghost doing so eliminates Mare **This does not include televisions, computers, car alarms, or radios *Has a chance of turning the lights off immediately if a player turns it on nearby, giving an EMF 2 reading **Note that any ghost can do this by chance **10-second cooldown on a per-light basis, if you turn the light on before the cooldown is over it will restart **Mare must be within 4 metres of the light to potentially trigger ability | *Hunt sanity threshold: 40% if lights on, 60% if off **Applies even if fuse box is off/broken *Decreases interactions if room is lit *More likely to perform light-shattering ghost events *More likely to perform long roams when lights are on; having the ghost roam frequently when lights are on could indicate a Mare |- !Moroi<br> | *Curses a player if Spirit Box response obtained or whisper through Parabolic Microphone heard. This doubles their sanity drain, and lights will not stop sanity drain. Curse temporarily pauses when player is outside the house, and Sanity Medications remove the curse for a player. **Take note of sanity at time of receiving spirit box/paramic response and a few minutes after; if one person's sanity drops noticeably quicker than others, then it could be due to the curse **Sanity can drain in other ways, such as ghost events or abilities; try to eliminate these possibilities *Speed based on current average sanity (1.5 m/s base speed above 45% sanity, 2.25 m/s at ~0% sanity). Will also increase speed in line-of-sight **If base speed increases over several hunts, then it could be a Moroi **Ensure that it is not a Hantu by keeping the fuse box on (if possible) *Smudging during a hunt \"blinds\" the Moroi for 50% longer. | |- !Myling | *Footsteps and vocalisations can only be heard within 12 metres (instead of 20 metres) *Test: Go to a hiding spot and place an active electronic on the ground. If the ghost's footsteps/vocalisations are audible only when the specified electronic starts flickering (within 10 metres of ghost), then it is probably a Myling **Note that the Raiju interferes with electronics from further (15 metres) **This test is not reliable if the ghost is on a different floor, since electronics will not flicker **Some vocalisations can be very soft; try listening for footsteps in this case **Note the audible range being slightly larger than the interference range. Some specific audio setups may allow you to hear the ghost before electronics flicker | *Increased frequency of paranormal sounds when listening through parabolic microphone |- !Obake<br> | *16.7% chance to leave unique fingerprint pattern: Six-fingered handprints instead of five, two fingerprints on light switches instead of one, and five fingerprints on keyboards and Prison cell block gates instead of four *During a hunt, can appear as a different ghost model during a flicker *25% chance to not leave fingerprints when interacting with a valid surface (for standard difficulties). If you see it leave a fingerprint once but not on another time, then it is probably an Obake *Occasional ability to halve the remaining duration of existing fingerprints on the map | |- !Oni | *Will never cause \"airball\" ghost event (airball chases a player, before disappearing with a hiss); a ghost doing so eliminates Oni **Will still hiss if it manifests to chase a player and disappears due to colliding with the player **Some maps have a larger mist that will fly out of the building in a straight line and disappear. Seeing this also eliminates Oni *Will be visible for a longer period when flickering during hunts; seeing a ghost that doesn't disappear as often as other ghosts during a hunt makes it probably an Oni | *During ghost events, more likely to use its full ghost model instead of a shadow or translucent form *Double sanity drain during a ghost event if it collides with a player (20% instead of 10%) |- !Onryo | *Will never light fire sources *If attempts to hunt within 4 metres of a flame (firelight, igniter, Maple Lodge Campsite campfire), it will blow out the flame instead *In addition, prioritises blowing out a flame instead of using a crucifix *Confusingly, every third flame that the Onryo blows out will also cause it to hunt **Can still be prevented by normal methods (crucifix/incense/another lit flame) *Test: At high sanity, place a crucifix down, then a lit firelight directly on top of it. Let it blow out the firelight 3 times; if it hunts on the third blowout, then it is likely an Onryo (try to eliminate Demon as a possibility) **This test is better performed using Tier I or II crucifixes, since they have a smaller or equal range as a flame. Tier III crucifixes may lead to inaccurate results if the ghost attempts to hunt within range of the crucifix but outside range of the flame *Test: Spread out multiple lit firelights in the favourite room and nearby (as desired), then keep them continously lit while average sanity is low. If it attempts to hunt (e.g. burns a crucifix) without blowing out the firelights, then it is not an Onryo. If the ghost refuses to hunt, it could be (but not definitely) an Onryo **The Shade will not hunt if at least one player is in its room. Try to eliminate this ghost before testing for Onryo | *Hunt sanity threshold of 60% |- !Phantom | *Taking a photo of a Phantom will make it instantly and temporarily disappear for that specific instance that it appears **Will not end the ghost event or hunt, but in ghost events, electronics will no longer flicker **Ghost photo will have no interference, and the ghost will not be visible. Note that this can occur for any ghost if the photo is taken exactly at the end of the ghost event/hunt, and the photo can also have no interference if taken from another floor **Best to check if the ghost event continues (listen for ghost vocalisations) **This also applies to photos taken while the Phantom is visible in D.O.T.S. *During a hunt, flashes visible every 1 to 2 seconds as opposed to every 0.3 to 1 seconds for other ghosts. The ghost being invisible for long periods could indicate a Phantom | *Will occasionally walk (invisibly) to a random player outside of hunts/ghost events; seeing ghost activity far away from the favourite room (especially on larger maps) could indicate a Phantom/Wraith/Banshee/The Twins |- !Poltergeist | *Has an ability to throw all nearby items at the same time. Create several piles of objects in and near the favourite room (try not to stack items), then see if the ghost throws multiple objects at once **Can throw items using its ability even when the lights are on, unlike other ghosts which can only throw things in the dark | *During a hunt, has a 100% chance to throw an item in its path every 0.5 seconds, instead of 50% with all other ghosts **Noticing a considerable number of items being thrown around (much more than usual) after the hunt could indicate a Poltergeist *Tends to throw objects more frequently than other ghosts in general **Note that all ghosts cannot throw items if the room they are currently standing in is lit, though the multithrow ability overrides this *Can throw items much further than other ghosts (up to twice as far). Noticing items being \"shot\" across the room (i.e, a dining utensil found across the living room from the nearby dining room) could indicate Poltergeist |- !Raiju | *Fixed speed of 2.5 m/s if there is at least one piece of active electronic equipment nearby (within 6-10 metres depending on map size) **Standard ghost speed if not near these equipment *Electronic interference range during ghost events or hunts is 15 metres, compared to the standard 10 metres **Like other ghosts, does not interfere with electronics on a different floor **Detection range is still 7.5 metres like other ghosts *Getting EMF Level 5 and Ghost Orbs on difficulties with 2 evidences (e.g. Nightmare) confirms Raiju, since the only other ghost that has these two evidences is the Obake, which has Ultraviolet as a guaranteed evidence | *Hunt sanity threshold is 65% if at least one piece of active electronic equipment nearby, otherwise 50% |- !Revenant | *During a hunt, moves at 1 m/s if no player detected. If a player is detected or when moving to last known player location, moves at 3 m/s. After arriving at last known location, it will decrease its speed by 0.75 m/s² until it reaches 1 m/s (over ~2.7 seconds) | |- !Shade | *Cannot interact with items, perform ghost events, or hunt if at least one player is in the same room as the ghost, regardless of average sanity **Can still happen if it wanders into a room with no players **Note that turning lights on in a standard ghost's current room will prevent EMF 3 interactions (throws) but not EMF 2 interactions (door touch, window knock, etc.) *If summoned by a Summoning Circle, a Music Box, or a Monkey Paw, has a chance of appearing as a shadow instead of a full form; will return to normal upon hunt starting | *Above 50% average sanity, increasing sanity means decreasing chance of ghost events; a ghost event at very high sanity may mean that a Shade is unlikely (but not impossible) *Hunt sanity threshold of 35% *Increased chance of airball ghost events instead of manifesting. If it does manifest, has increased chance of using shadow model instead of full/translucent form |- !Spirit | *Cleansing prevents hunts for 180 seconds instead of 90 seconds **Test: Get sanity as low as possible, then cleanse the ghost and wait. If it hunts before 180 seconds is up, then it is not a Spirit. Hunting only after 180 seconds may indicate (though not definitely) a Spirit **Take care to not use Incense when the ghost is standing on stairs, as this can cause the cleansing effect to miss - hunting before 60 seconds means that the ghost was not actually cleansed | |- !Thaye | *Has \"age\" parameter, where it will age the more time players spend in the same room as the Thaye. Speed is based on age and does not speed up with line-of-sight; is fast at youngest (2.7 m/s at age 0) and slow when old (1 m/s at age 10) *Getting Ghost Writing and D.O.T.S Projector on difficulties with 2 evidences (e.g. Nightmare) confirms Thaye, since the only other ghost that has these two evidences is the Deogen, which has Spirit Box as guaranteed evidence | *Age parameter also affects activity and hunt sanity threshold: **Twice as active compared to normal ghost when youngest, half as active compared to normal ghost when oldest **75% hunt sanity threshold at youngest, 15% at oldest |- !The Mimic | *Ghost Orbs as \"secondary evidence\" or ability in addition to main evidences; this means that they will always be present, even on 0-evidence difficulties **For example, you can obtain Ultraviolet, Spirit Box, and Ghost Orbs on Nightmare difficulty. If the difficulty gives less than 3 evidence, check for presence of additional evidence **If you get EMF 5, Ghost Writing, or D.O.T.S Projector, you can safely eliminate The Mimic since it cannot mimic evidence types from other ghosts *Randomly mimics another ghost, along with all its abilities and behaviour, such as 6-fingered handprints when mimicking Obake. Will change every 30 seconds to 2 minutes, but will not change during hunts **Look for the ghost demonstrating two completely different traits (such as noticing the ghost flickering slower like a Phantom during a hunt, when it was not doing so earlier) | *Since The Mimic can imitate any other ghost's properties, it is important to eliminate it as a possibility before making any conclusions about other ghosts (e.g. concluding that it's a Wraith because it didn't disturb salt) |- !The Twins | *Has two separate interaction ranges; the first within 2.12 metres (4.24 metres on large maps) and the second within 8.48 metres (16.97 metres on large maps). Occasionally, will interact with the environment almost simultaneously (within 1 second) using these two ranges; noticing two interactions occurring in very quick succession at two separate locations, especially several times, can indicate The Twins **Use EMF readers and see if both readings stop within less than 1 second of each other. **All ghosts can interact with items within about 2 seconds in between, while cursed possessions can also cause near-simultaneous interactions (e.g. repeatedly using Voodoo Doll) **Interactions for all ghosts happen in a radius confined to the same floor; they can interact through walls in an adjacent room *Depending on where hunt starts, has slightly different base speed; 1.5 m/s if it starts from where the ghost actually is, and 1.9 m/s if it starts from the location where the large-range interaction occurred | *Because it is one ghost with two interaction ranges, you could misidentify where the ghost actually is; noticing a single interaction in one area, but then realising that the ghost was never there (e.g. absence of low temperatures/another room is of low temperatures) could indicate The Twins. Other indicators of ghost presence include motion sensors to track ghost movement, and evidences *Look for items interacted with by the ghost far away from ghost room (e.g. thrown objects, turned-on lights). Seeing ghost activity far away from the favourite room (especially on larger maps) could indicate a The Twins/Phantom/Wraith/Banshee *50% chance to hunt from where the ghost actually is, or from \"ranged\" interaction **The ghost hunting far away from the favourite room could indicate The Twins, one of the ghosts mentioned above, or simply a very roamy ghost *Crucifixes only work from the ghost's actual position, so \"Fast Twin\" hunts can appear to begin directly on top of a crucifix |- !Wraith | *Will never disturb salt piles, even during hunts **If the ghost never steps in salt after a long time, then it is likely (though not definitely) a Wraith **Test: During a ghost event or while the ghost is in a visible D.O.T.S. state, place salt under the ghost. Alternatively, place salt beneath a Motion Sensor. If it doesn't disturb the pile despite walking over it, then it is a Wraith. This is best done with stationary ghost events (e.g. singing) | *Can teleport to a random player when not hunting/performing ghost events, leaving an EMF 2/5 reading. Seeing ghost activity far away from the favourite room (especially on larger maps) could indicate a Wraith/The Twins/Phantom/Banshee |- !Yokai | *Can only sense player voices/held electronics within 2.5 metres **Test: During a hunt, stand in a room at a suitable distance away from the ghost, hold an electronic equipment (to check if the ghost is within 10 metres), then repeatedly talk/use global chat (since voice detection for normal ghosts is 9 metres as opposed to electronic detection, which is 7.5 metres). If the ghost is nearby with no line-of-sight but does not enter the player's room despite the potential attraction, then it could be a Yokai. Note that the ghost going to the player does not eliminate Yokai, since it could have wandered over by chance | *Hunt sanity threshold is 80% if players are talking in the same room as the ghost, otherwise 50% *Increased ghost activity if players are talking near the ghost |- !Yurei | *Has an ability where it will drop the sanity of all players within 7.5 meters of it by 15%, while also closing a door gently at the same time **This does not count during ghost events or hunts *Cannot slightly move doors outside of hunts | *Will walk back to favourite room and not wander out for 90 seconds when smudged. Place a Motion Sensor at the doorway, then smudge the ghost. If the motion sensor is never set off by the ghost within the next 90 seconds, then the ghost could be a Yurei. This test is not very reliable **Ghost events override this mechanic |} ==Other tips== ===Elimination by negatives=== If you can be sure that the ghost will not provide a particular piece of evidence, you can eliminate all ghosts that have that piece of evidence. This also works on Nightmare difficulty, but requires two negatives instead; for example, if you can be sure that the ghost will not give both Fingerprints and Freezing Temperatures, then you can eliminate four ghosts: Demon, Hantu, Jinn, and The Mimic. Conclusively eliminating evidence may be trickier for chance-related evidence like EMF Level 5, for example. This strategy is more useful if you are unable to easily find evidence in the first place. ===Speed-altering defensive equipment=== Some higher-tier defensive equipment, such as Tier III Salt and Tier II and III Incense, can temporarily reduce or even halt the ghost's movement entirely, potentially masking the unique movement behavior of several ghost types. Past being mindful of these attributes, if the ghost needs to be identified through its speed or movement, using lower tier defensive items that do not affect the ghost's movement can be considered, although this will require giving up the significant power of these higher tier items. ==See also== *Ghost#Evidence *Ghost#Ghost types Category:Guides fr:Guides/Identifier les entités","title":"Guides/Identifying ghosts","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Guides/Identifying_ghosts"}
{"content":"The Jinn is a type of ghost in Phasmophobia. The Jinn can be empowered by an active Fuse Box to quickly close in on targets that it is chasing during a Hunt. ==Behavior== ===Activity=== The Jinn cannot directly turn off the fuse box. However, it can still indirectly turn off the fuse box by turning too many lights on and overloading it. There is a popular myth claiming the Jinn will interact with electronics more often rather than other interactions; this is not true. The Jinn has an equal chance of interacting with anything nearby. ===Ability=== When near a player and the fuse box is on, the Jinn will occasionally use an ability that lowers the sanity of one player in the same room or otherwise within 3 meters of it by 25%. The player who will lose sanity is the first in the list (established by the order the players joined the lobby) among players in range. An EMF 2 or 5 reading will then be generated at the fuse box. ===Hunt=== During a hunt, if all of the following three criteria are satisfied: *The fuse box is turned on *The Jinn has line-of-sight with a player it is targeting *The Jinn is further than 3 metres from that player Then its speed will be fixed at 2.5 m/s while the criteria are met. Otherwise, it will obey standard ghost speeds with one particularity: while it is travelling at the fixed 2.5 m/s speed, the speed increase from continuous line-of-sight adds in the background, and will be applied once one criteria is no longer satisfied. Whether there are lights turned on or not does not affect the Jinn's abilities. ==Evidence== ==Strengths and weaknesses== These are the strengths and weaknesses as listed in the journal: Strength: A Jinn will travel at a faster speed if its victim is far away. Weakness: Turning off the location's power source will prevent the Jinn from using its ability. ==Strategies== Turning off the location's breaker will prevent the Jinn from using any of its abilities. However, this will render the map's electrical lights inactive, leading to players' sanity draining as a consequence of being in the dark more often. Players will need to decide if preventing the Jinn from using its abilities is worth dealing with more frequent hunts as a result of lower average sanity, though this loss can be mitigated by holding lit candles to reduce passive sanity drain. ===Identification=== There are two ways to identify a Jinn, both methods with the breaker turned on: *Wait for a hunt at the end of a long room or corridor, standing far away from where the ghost is expected to enter the room, and with line-of-sight all the way through. Listen for its footsteps and observe its speed before and after it sees the player. If it instantly gains speed to chase the player, then it is likely a Jinn; use Incense if needed. **Be careful not to mistake this with a Revenant; while they both exhibit the same behaviour (instant speed-up upon spotting a player), a Revenant's speed change will be much more drastic. *Leave an EMF reader at the fuse box while the fuse box is on; if it picks up a reading but the fuse box never turned off, then it is very likely the Jinn using its ability, barring any other items that could have caused the reading (such as the fuse box door itself). Keep in mind that a fuse box turning off on its own does not rule out a Jinn, as they can still indirectly turn off fuse boxes by turning on too many lights and causing the fuse box to trip. If a fuse box trips, all light switches will also turn off, which can be used to distinguish from a ghost manually turning the fuse box off, which leaves light switches untouched. In custom difficulties with the fuse box broken, or if it is broken with the Monkey Paw's \"I wish for activity\" wish, a Jinn becomes impossible to identify through behavior, and thus can only be identified with evidence; in 0 evidence runs in particular, this makes a Jinn almost completely impossible to identify, as the only way to identify a Jinn under these conditions is to painstakingly rule out every other ghost type - depending on the room the ghost is in, this sometimes can become impossible. ==Trivia== *Jinns are derived from Arabic mythology, and were later integrated as part of Islamic theology. They are a type of spirit/being created before mankind out of smoke-free fire. Usually invisible, they can take shape in many forms including serpents, winged beings, giants, insects, or humanoids. Jinns are not undead, and they live, eat, age, and have children like humans.

{"content":"This guide dispels common misconceptions and myths about game mechanics in Phasmophobia. ==Investigation== ===Being in a lit room will always stop passive sanity drain=== Passive sanity drain is dependent on whether the room's \"main lights\" — chiefly ceiling light fixtures — are turned on or not. Other light sources that may be present in the room, such as table lamps, floor lamps, and electronic devices like televisions, will not prevent passive sanity drain despite illuminating the room to some degree. Additionally, in larger rooms with a lower overall light level, such as most hallways in Sunny Meadows Mental Institution, having the main lights on will not completely prevent passive sanity drain either, instead reducing it to 80% of the normal rate, which can cause sanity drain to be perceived as faster on these maps, depending on individual playstyle (whether the lights are usually turned on to preserve sanity). Firelights within 2 metres of the player will reduce, but not stop, passive sanity drain, with the effectiveness dependent on the tier. ===The radio messages at the beginning of an investigation will hint about the ghost type and/or its behaviour=== These messages are simply there for immersion and are chosen randomly. They do not correlate to the ghost type or give any indication about its behaviour at all. ===My dead body photo must be taken for me to receive insurance payout=== The dead body photo does not affect whether a player receives insurance, and instead awards a small amount of cash depending on how many stars the photo has much like any other. Insurance is instead given automatically, the value of which being a portion of the purchase price of all equipment added by that player for the contract. Insurance is only given on Intermediate difficulty and lower. ===A sloped line with a break on the activity graph is a dead giveaway of The Twins=== While the appearance of a sloped line containing a break on the activity graph can be indicative of The Twins, especially if it appears on both sides of a hump representing a rise in activity, it is not exclusive to The Twins ghost type and can appear with any given ghost. ==Items and Equipment== ===Higher EMF readings mean imminent danger=== The level of an EMF reading has no correlation to a ghost's overall activity or aggression. Instead, EMF readings are individually linked to specific actions from the ghost; for example, the ghost opening or closing a door gives an EMF level 2, and it throwing an object will give an EMF level 3. Also note that EMF readings do not add up on the EMF reader. This means that a ghost interacting with two adjacent doors (EMF level 2 each) will not give an EMF level 4, but will instead create two separate EMF 2 readings, one for each interaction. Continuing on this, an EMF Level 5 reading is simply a random chance of an EMF level 2 or EMF level 3, and is unrelated to whether the ghost is going to attack soon. In the same vein, getting a series of higher EMF readings does not necessarily mean that the ghost will trigger an EMF Level 5 either. ===The lowest temperature in the room indicates the ghost's exact location=== This is not true; the temperature at every point within a room will be exactly the same. Furthermore, the thermometer's reading always fluctuates, hence whether it is lower in a specific spot is not meaningful in terms of the exact position of the ghost. Even then, low or freezing temperatures is not a guarantee of the ghost being in a particular room at a specific time, as temperatures rise and fall slowly when the ghost leaves or enters a room. ===\"What is your favourite room\" with the Ouija Board gives the favourite room=== Asking for the name of the favourite room only gives an answer of the ghost's current room, regardless of how the location question is phrased. People may have found it to give the favourite room in earlier versions, but this is because the ghost tended to roam around less and stay in its favourite room, hence giving the impression that asking for the favourite room was accurate. On the other hand, the Haunted Mirror does show the favourite room, even if the ghost is elsewhere when it is used. ===The smoke emitted from extinguished firelights indicates that the ghost interacted with them=== No, candles will always emit the same type of smoke regardless of what caused them to go out. However, a \"huffing\" sound will be heard if a candle is blown out by the ghost, which is not the case if it burns out on its own. ===Using the Spirit Box/leaving the Spirit Box on lowers sanity=== Using the spirit box and obtaining a response will not drain sanity on its own. However, as using the spirit box requires the player to be in a dark room, passive sanity drain from darkness will apply normally. Note that the Moroi has a unique ability where it will \"curse\" the player using the Spirit Box upon answering, causing their passive sanity drain to be increased until the curse is lifted. ===Flashlights must be turned off when using the Spirit Box=== Using the spirit box requires on-site lights in the player's current room to be turned off, but not player-brought equipment. The ghost will still give responses even with flashlights on or if there are firelights burning in the room. This also applies for lights in adjacent rooms; the Spirit Box will still work even if doors are open or the \"room\" is not separated by a physical wall (such as the kitchen and the dining room on Bleasdale Farmhouse). ===Crucifixes can stop ongoing hunts and/or protect the player from the ghost=== The only function of the crucifix is to prevent hunts from happening if the ghost is within its effective range. Crucifixes will have no effect on the ghost once it starts hunting, even against Demons. The only way to stop an ongoing hunt before its natural expiration is either for one player to be killed, which stops the hunt if Kills extend hunt duration is turned off, or all players to manage to leave the investigation area while a hunt is ongoing, the only legitimate method of doing so being using the Monkey Paw to unlock the exit doors and then walking outside. ===Using onsite objects or items has repercussions on the ghost's activity=== Interacting with the map, furniture and objects, even in an excessive way, will not rile up or anger the ghost into hunting, performing a ghost event or increasing its activity. The only map items that can trigger a hunt, event or activity from the ghost are cursed possessions, depending on how the cursed possession is used. ==Maps== ===Certain map ambient sounds can hint at the ghost's location=== Map ambient sounds (such as the screams echoing through Sunny Meadows Mental Institution or branches cracking on Maple Lodge Campsite) are there simply for immersion and are not tied to the ghost in any way. ===Ghosts can change their favourite room to any other room on the map=== In theory, this is true, but this will vary widely depending on the ghost's abilities, the difficulty settings on roaming and favourite room changing chance, the layout of the map, and whether the player uses cursed possessions. Ghosts have a chance of changing favourite room when performing long roams. *A ghost can realistically change from the Dining Room in Tanglewood to the Master Bedroom in one roam. *A ghost in the Foyer of Bleasdale Farmhouse would have to minimally change favourite rooms to the Upstairs Hallway first, before possibly changing to the Attic. *A ghost in the A/B blocks of Prison would find it very hard to change rooms to the front section of the map, since the intermediate hallway cannot be chosen as a favourite room. In general, the further a room is from the ghost's current favourite room, the lower the chance is of the ghost changing its favourite room to there. Exceptions include Wraiths and Phantoms which have an ability to travel directly to a player's location no matter how far away said player is (and subsequently have a chance to change their favourite room to a nearby room), and the \"I wish for sanity\" Monkey Paw wish, which changes the ghost's favourite room to a random room, which can be anywhere on the map. ==Hunt== ===Ghosts can be triggered to hunt by swearing at them/addressing them in certain ways=== This is not true. Saying the ghost's name or certain trigger words near the ghost only increases the chance of an interaction, not hunts. The only ghost which may hunt more often when players are talking near it is the Yokai, and this merely raises the hunt sanity threshold rather than causing it to hunt on command (and additionally concerns any sort of speech, not just trigger words/phrases). In other words, there are no ways to make ghosts start hunting simply by being vocally active. ===Ghosts who have EMF Level 5 evidence will give it out during hunts=== This is only partially true. While hunting, the Ghost still makes EMF interactions when it interacts with the environment. For example, if the ghost touches a door while searching for players, the door will still make a readable interaction. Once the ghost goes far enough away/stops hunting, which makes electronic equipment usable, one can then read the EMF level from that door, which could potentially be a level 5 reading. However, regardless of whether the ghost has EMF Level 5 as evidence, electronic interference when the ghost manifests during a hunt or a ghost event will only give levels 1 - 4 on an active EMF Reader. It is hence useless to check for EMF Level 5 when the reader is being interfered with during hunts, and is generally dangerous, as the active reader may broadcast the player's location to the ghost if used. ===The ghost will not hunt so long as at least one teammate has high sanity=== The probability of a hunt happening takes into account the average sanity of all players (displayed at the top of the Sanity Monitor inside the truck), regardless if they are outside or inside the investigation area. This means that a lone player with high sanity will still face very \"aggressive\" behaviour from the ghost if the rest of the players have low sanity, even if they all stay outside. The ghost only checks for the presence of a player inside the investigation area to initiate a hunt, not their individual sanity level. One exception to this is the Banshee, which will only check its target's sanity to hunt; if it selects a teammate with high sanity as its target, then it will indeed not hunt so long as that teammate's sanity stays above the threshold, even if all other teammates have low sanity, which also applies if the target is outside of the investigation area. ===Ghosts can chase the player outside the investigation area/into the truck=== This is not a feature of the game. If you see a ghost clearly outside the investigation area (and perhaps it kills someone), then someone in your lobby is likely modifying/hacking the game. There is a bug in the game where the ghost can kill players through exterior doors if they stand too close to them, causing players to die while outside the building, but this is due to a hitbox issue and not due to the ghost leaving the building; there is also a delay between a player getting caught and actually dying (during which the death animation is playing out), and a player can still move around while this is happening, which means if they die close to an exit door, they can walk outside the building and die outside. As an aside, crucifixes can prevent hunts when located outside of the investigation area, or even when sitting on the equipment wall in the truck, as crucifixes do not check for walls, obstacles, or zone boundaries to block a hunt, nor do they need to be activated in any way, just that the ghost is within the crucifix's range. Hunts prevented from the truck usually occur on maps where the truck is parked close enough to certain rooms (e.g. the garage of 42 Edgefield Road), and the ghost just so happened to be on the very edge of said rooms while it attempted to hunt and got caught in the crucifix's effective range; this is more likely to happen with Demons who have an increased crucifix range. ===Ghosts can see through doors or walls=== In general, most ghosts cannot see players through doors or walls, even transparent ones. For example, in 13 Willow Street, if you close the glass doors between the living room and the kitchen, it's possible to watch the ghost through them during a hunt without it seeing you. The same goes for the bars in Prison. However, during hunts, all ghosts can pass through doors as if they didn't exist. The only ghost who can see through physical objects is the Deogen, who will always know the location of the player no matter where they are on the map, rendering hiding or line-of-sight breaking completely useless. ===Ghosts can remember where you hid in a previous hunt/hiding in the same spot multiple hunts in a row is unsafe=== Ghosts will only have a 50% chance to \"remember\" where a player was during the next hunt if it saw a player in that specific spot in the previous hunt. If nobody was seen at or near that spot, it will not remember that you hid there. In the case someone was seen in the general area of a hiding spot (however not necessarily in the hiding spot), it may be safer to hide in a different place for the next hunt, as the ghost may wander around that area for a while before moving on, and incidentally may potentially find you hiding there. Players are then safe to return to that hiding spot in following hunts as the ghost's memory only lasts for one hunt. This also does not apply if you smudge the ghost with incense; the ghost does not have a chance to return to where it last saw you within the same hunt after a smudge. More likely, the ghost is already nearby, so the chance of it randomly wandering to you (or simply detecting you) is higher. Whether this is true between hunts has not been verified. In short, unless someone was seen at or near the spot in the immediate previous hunt, choosing to stay in the same spot across multiple hunts is no more dangerous than choosing to move. ===The ghost won't see me if I turn all the building lights off=== The ghost's vision is unaffected by darkness, and they can see players in the dark just as well as they can in the light. Conversely, ghosts do not actually \"see\" the light beam from a flashlight or any form of light-emitting equipment, instead simply sensing active electronic equipment in a fixed range. ===Using global chat during hunts could cause other players to die=== Unless the other player's microphone is picking up the sound from their own speaker, this is not the case. Using global chat during a hunt will attract the ghost to only the player who is pressing the button, if the ghost is within range. This was designed to prevent griefing in this manner where players attempt to kill other players. ==Ghosts== ===Lit firelights can affect the Hantu's speed=== Only the room's temperature (which can be read on a Thermometer) will affect its speed; firelights do not affect the room's temperature, and as such do not affect the Hantu's speed. Currently, the only source of flames that affect room temperatures is Camp Woodwind's campfire when lit. ===Jinns cannot interact with the fuse box door=== All ghosts, including the Jinn, are capable of interacting with the door covering the Fuse Box. The only thing the Jinn cannot do is directly touch the switch inside to turn the power off (and similarly, the Hantu cannot turn the switch on). ===Jinns will interact with electronics more often=== Jinns do not have a higher chance of interacting with electronics; they interact with electronic items in the same manner as other ghosts. ===Obakes can mimic player models=== Obakes cannot mimic player models. They can only briefly change into another ghost model on specific blinks during a hunt. This misconception may derive from a special ghost event that was scrapped early after pre-release where the ghost could mimic player models. ===The Onryo's ability to hunt after blowing out a third flame bypasses crucifixes, smudging and other lit flames=== This ability hunt can still be blocked by crucifixes, smudging, and other lit flames. Other ghost's ability hunts can also be blocked by normal hunt prevention methods. Only cursed hunts cannot be blocked (with the exception of a nearby fully intact Tier III crucifix). Note that there is a potential bug under investigation where ghosts wrongly determine their current room when above a basement, and this is speculated to result in a secondary bug such as the Onryo bypassing crucifixes, incense and flames for its ability hunt. ===Extinguishing firelights manually can cause an Onryo to hunt=== An Onryo's three-flame hunt only counts flames that the ghost itself blows out; players extinguishing flames have no effect whatsoever on an Onryo hunting, other than potentially letting it start a hunt when the lit flame would've prevented it. ===Raijus can drain power from any electronic source=== Only active electronic equipment brought in from the truck (e.g. flashlights, active sensors and projectors, active head gear, etc.) will power the Raiju's abilities. Other sources of electricity, like power sources that depend on the breaker (native lighting, alarm clock/radio, computers, TVs, etc.) do not boost the Raiju, so there is no need to turn these off beforehand. ===The Mimic's Ghost Orbs will follow the ghost/work differently from other ghosts=== The Mimic's Ghost Orbs function no differently from that of other ghosts'; they will stay in the favourite room, move around in a random direction like other ghosts' orbs, and swap rooms only when the favourite room changes. ===The Twins is two functional ghosts=== Code-wise, The Twins is just one ghost, however it has two separate interaction ranges: the normal range and an \"extended\" range, which allows it to interact with items that are very far away from it, giving off the illusion that there is another ghost roaming the building. When The Twins tries to hunt, there is a 50/50 chance that it will either hunt from where it is standing or near from where it last interacted with its extended range. ===Banshees will not hunt if their target is outside the investigation area=== A Banshee can hunt even if the target is outside (even though it will still only check the target's sanity), and will simply behave like any other ghost during a hunt, chasing any opportune player. ===Extremely low temperatures are a sign of a Hantu=== All ghosts which give Freezing Temperatures evidence are capable of reducing a room's temperature all the way to -10°C, and the Hantu is not known to reduce a room's temperature any more quickly than other ghosts. ==Journal text== ===If the ghost is a Phantom, the cursed possession is more likely to be a Ouija Board, and vice versa=== Phantoms and Ouija Boards are not related gameplay-wise in any way. ===If the ghost is a Deogen, the weather is more likely to be Fog, and vice versa=== The \"endless fog\" mentioned in the Deogen's journal is simply flavour text and has no gameplay effects whatsoever. ===Spirits are more common than other ghosts, and Hantus are rarer than other ghosts=== All ghosts have the same chance of being chosen, including Spirits and Hantus, contrary to their journal entry stating Spirits are \"very common\" while Hantus are \"rare\". These journal entries are merely brief decorative passages, and are in no way gameplay-significant. ===Yokais are more common in the suburban house maps=== Despite the mention of \"family homes\" in the Yokai's journal, these maps don't have a particularly higher chance of choosing a Yokai as the ghost. As aforementioned, each ghost has an equal chance of being chosen. ===Onryos will avoid lit firelights=== Firelights do not affect how much the Onryo roams or moves, and any open flames will only prevent the Onryo from initiating a hunt in a similar manner to crucifixes. ===Wraiths will avoid salt at all costs=== Wraiths are not \"afraid\" of salt, and placing salt near it will not affect how much it roams or moves, nor do they actively avoid salt via pathfinding around it; it will simply pass though salt piles without disturbing them, including during hunts, and have no further interactions with them. ===Wraiths can fly and walk through walls=== This references the Wraith's ability to walk through salt piles without disturbing them, and teleporting to players respectively; Wraiths cannot actually fly between floors, hover off the ground during hunts or manifestation events, or move through walls (only doors, which all other ghosts are also capable of doing). ===Moving far enough away from a Moroi can break its curse=== This does not happen in-game, even on the larger maps such as Sunny Meadows or Brownstone High School. The only way to break a Moroi's curse is to take Sanity Medication.

{"content":"Ghost Orbs are a type of evidence used to help determine the type of ghost haunting the location. ==Mechanics== When a map is loaded in, Ghost Orbs will spawn in the favourite room and float within the room. They look like very small orbs that glide across the screen, generally one at a time. They can be seen through the screen on a Video Camera with night vision, or through any available video feed with night vision, but not through night vision goggles (Tier III Head Gear). Depending on the map and the location of the favourite room, Ghost Orbs can sometimes be seen via the map's CCTVs if the CCTV happens to be facing into the favourite room, though this is usually rare. Ghost Orbs will periodically shift position within the favourite room, forcing players to be more proactive in locating them. When the ghost room changes on difficulties where 'Changing favourite room' is not set to 'None' (such as on Professional, Nightmare, or Insanity), the Ghost Orbs will also move to the new favourite room. ===Rewards=== Filming a Ghost Orb will yield a Ghost Orbs video in the journal, rewarding up to $12 and 12 XP, depending on the tier of the video camera and whether there is a Unique stamp. == Possible ghosts== {| class=\"article-table\" |+ |Banshee |Ghost Orb |D.O.T.S Projector |Ultraviolet |- |Dayan |Ghost Orb |EMF Level 5 |Spirit Box |- |Hantu |Ghost Orb |Ultraviolet |Freezing Temperatures |- |Mare |Ghost Orb |Spirit Box |Ghost Writing |- |Obake |Ghost Orb |EMF Level 5 |Ultraviolet |- |Onryo |Ghost Orb |Freezing Temperatures |Spirit Box |- |Raiju |Ghost Orb |D.O.T.S Projector |EMF Level 5 |- |Revenant |Ghost Orb |Freezing Temperatures |Ghost Writing |- |Thaye |Ghost Orb |D.O.T.S Projector |Ghost Writing |- |Yokai |Ghost Orb |D.O.T.S Projector |Spirit Box |- |Yurei |Ghost Orb |D.O.T.S Projector |Freezing Temperatures |} The Mimic induces Ghost Orbs as a \"false flag\" evidence. Since its main pieces of evidences are Spirit Box, Ultraviolet, and Freezing Temperatures, Ghost Orbs will be unaffected by the number of evidences set (such as on Custom difficulties or Nightmare difficulty), even when it is set to 0. ==Strategies== *Because of the periodical moving of Ghost Orbs, searching for them with a hand-held Video Camera is often better than relying on stationary cameras. In addition, this eliminates back-and-forth trips to the truck, especially on larger maps where sanity preservation is more important. *A player in the truck can view their teammates' Tier I head gear during the initial search for the ghost room to search for Ghost Orbs. *If viewing the camera feed from the truck, camera placement is key to detecting Ghost Orbs. A good strategy for detecting them is placing two video cameras in the corners of the room facing each other to maximize coverage, or using a Tier 2 or 3 tripod to rotate the camera. *Using video cameras to peer through exit doors, garage doors or windows may allow the player to find Ghost Orbs even before entering the investigation area. *Ghost Orbs tend to show up in regular intervals. If none are seen for a long time, try moving the video camera or switch to another one. *In outdoor areas such as on Maple Lodge Campsite, Ghost Orbs can be hard to see in bad weather conditions (primarily rain, snow, and fog). A hint to distinguishing them from snowflakes is that Ghost Orbs tend to float more horizontally and, sometimes, even upwards (compared to snowflakes always falling down). Additionally, snowflakes are generally dark, while orbs will be bright. *It is best to check for Ghost Orbs when the room's lights are off. When on, the brightness may hide the Orbs from sight. ==Gallery== <gallery caltionalign=\"center\"> Mega Guide - Community Request - Phasmophobia.gif|An animation of the Ghost Orb moving pre-Exposition.

{"content":"The Revenant is a type of ghost in Phasmophobia. It is widely considered one of the most dangerous ghosts in the game, due to its ability to quickly catch up to players during a hunt. == Behavior == === Hunt === Revenants have very noticeable speed change between roaming and chasing modes. When a Revenant is roaming, it will move at 1 m/s. However, as soon as it detects a player (either visually or through speech/electronics), it will begin to move at 3 m/s (nearly twice the base speed of most other ghosts) and sustains this speed until it reaches the spot where it last detected a player. If and when reverting to roaming mode, the Revenant's speed will slowly decrease over ~2.7 seconds (deceleration rate of 0.75 m/s²) back to its initial value of 1 m/s. Contrary to most other ghosts, the Revenant will not speed up with continuous line-of-sight. == Evidence == == Strengths and weaknesses == These are the strengths and weaknesses as listed in the journal: Strength: A Revenant will travel at a significantly faster speed when hunting their prey. Weakness: Hiding from the Revenant will cause it to move very slowly. == Strategy == Due to the Revenant's power, it is critical to hide as soon as possible and the player must exercise extreme caution as to not give away their position during a hunt. A player will not be able to outrun a Revenant for long before it catches up to them. If you are caught running from a Revenant, items such as tier III Salt or Incense can slow it/ward it off for a few seconds, giving you enough time to create some distance between you and the ghost to hide from it. Tier III Sanity Medication is also a possibility, with the infinite sprint allowing you to match the Revenant's speed for 10 seconds to potentially run to safety. === Identification === While hiding, listen for the ghost's footsteps; if the footsteps are relatively few and far between while the ghost is nearby, then it is most likely a Revenant. Alternatively, if the player already has some sort of escape plan ready, simply letting the ghost detect the player and seeing if it gets a sudden, extremely significant speed boost is a simple way to figure out if it's a Revenant or not - just be mindful of confusing it for a Jinn, which will also speed up suddenly when it sees a player (though a Jinn and Revenant should be easy to distinguish from their roaming speeds). == Trivia == * The word \"Revenant\" comes from French, originally formed from the verb revenir (\"to return\"). * According to folklore, a Revenant is a corpse that has been revived from the dead to haunt the living. They originate across many regions and religions, including Old Irish Celtic and Norse mythology. * Many use the term \"Revenant\" interchangeably for \"ghost\" or \"undead\". * The Revenant is widely regarded as one of the most dangerous ghosts in the game, quite apart from its behaviour before 0.8.0 where it would only speed up when having a player in line-of-sight making them extremely easy to escape from by breaking line-of-sight, rather than speeding up to the player's last known location as well. ==History == {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access Alpha |- !7 March 2020 |Added Revenant. |- !13 March 2020 |Revenant now requires Fingerprints instead of Bug as one of its evidences. |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !0.3.0 |Prior to 0.3.0, the evidence was EMF Level 5, Fingerprints, and Ghost Writing. |- !rowspan=\"3\" |0.8.0 |Revenants now gain speed boost simply by detecting a player. |- |Revenants now sustain their chasing speed until they reach the last known player location. |- |Speed will now decrease at a rate of 0.75 m/s² after losing player instead of instantly. |} == References == ru:Ревенант fr:Revenant Category:Ghosts","title":"Revenant","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Revenant"}
{"content":"The Obake is a type of ghost in Phasmophobia. Described in the journal as a shapeshifter, their primary power is their ability to create unique fingerprints. ==Behaviour== ===Activity=== Each time the Obake interacts with a valid surface, it has a 75% chance of leaving fingerprints, instead of the usual 100%. After stepping in salt, it also has a 75% chance each step, instead of 100%, of leaving a footprint, creating no footstep sound when the chance fails. In multiplayer, the missing footprints are not synchronized between players, which may lead to a different number of footprints and footstep sounds for each player. When creating handprints or fingerprints, there is a one-sixth (~16.7%) chance for the Obake to create a unique handprint/fingerprint pattern: *A six-fingered handprint instead of the usual five fingers *Two fingerprints instead of one on light switches, lamps, and TV remotes *Five fingerprints instead of four on keyboards and Prison cell doors When performing a fake hunt ghost event or a Music Box event, the Obake is the only ghost that will sometimes miss a footstep sound. This is very likely a bug. ===Ability=== The Obake occasionally triggers an ability to reduce the remaining time for all existing fingerprints on the map by half. For example, two fingerprints lingering on the map with 40 seconds and 70 seconds before timing out and disappearing are cut in half to 20 and 35 seconds remaining respectively. This ability can be triggered multiple times in quick succession, making it possible for an instance of fingerprints to last for mere seconds before vanishing. ===Hunt=== During a hunt, the Obake will occasionally shapeshift into a different ghost model of the same gender during a flicker. Dead players cannot see this shapeshift. A shapeshift will always occur on the 12th, 27th, 39th, 54th, 62nd, 80th, 105th, 120th, and 132nd flickers (starting with the first flicker-in) of a hunt. *This means that the first shapeshift will happen approximately 7 - 9 seconds after the grace period ends. *This also means that the Obake will not shapeshift at all if the hunt ends prematurely (after the ghost kills a player or when all players leave the investigation area), as it will not have the time to reach the 12th flicker. When shapeshifting, the Obake has an order of models it will use. The first shapeshift of the contract will always be using the first ghost model in the following list. The second shapeshift will then use the second model, the third one the third model, and so on with the list looping on itself. When the Obake reaches its own model in the list, it will shapeshift into itself with a more or less visible posture reset. {| class=\"fandom-table\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Male ghosts !Female ghosts |- | → → → → → → | → → → |} <br>Both the shapeshifting and the fingerprint duration's reduction will count as an ability in the post-game statistics. ==Evidence== On limited evidence (1/2 evidence) games, an Obake will always have Ultraviolet as one of its evidence types. This does not affect its ability to occasionally not leave fingerprints on a surface. ==Strengths and weaknesses== These are the strengths and weaknesses as listed in the journal: Strength: When interacting with the environment, an Obake will rarely leave a trace. Weakness: Sometimes this ghost will shapeshift, leaving behind unique evidence. ==Strategies== If the ghost touches a surface and leaves no fingerprints, then later leaves fingerprints on another surface, or vice versa, this usually points to the ghost being an Obake. If an Obake is suspected, checking a touched surface with a UV Light each time it interacts with a door or the like is prudent to spotting the Obake's special fingerprints, both to maximize the chances of spotting them and to note any instances of them rapidly disappearing. Note that getting normal fingerprints, even several times repeatedly, does not rule out an Obake outright. Although the Obake has a 75% chance to leave Ultraviolet evidence, due to probability, it is possible for the Obake to always leave fingerprints on surfaces that it touches much like any other ghost with Ultraviolet. It's also possible for an Obake to interact with nearby doors frequently enough that it can effectively \"mask\" an instance where it does not leave fingerprints during one interaction by instead providing them in a separate interaction moments later, as well as conceal its ability to quickly decay its fingerprints. If you are on a zero-evidence run, the Obake will never produce fingerprints nor footprints, and will mainly be identified by spotting its shapeshifting power during a hunt. In multiplayer, one player can stay in the investigation area and hide while other players can look through set-up Video Cameras in safety while the ghost is hunting; in singleplayer, strong looping skills are very favorable in order to maintain sight on it for extended periods of time to catch it changing models during a flicker. * Finding a proper looping spot is important; some spots such as the cars in some suburban houses do not allow the player to see the ghost when looping it, and trying to identify an Obake by looping there is pointless. * This tends to become much easier if the ghost is using the child or Patient 07 model, as those models can also be crawling (or bent backwards in the case of Patient 07), and will reset to the normal standing posture when it shifts, resulting in a sudden, extremely obvious posture change for a single blink. * Usage of Incense or Tier III Salt to hinder the ghost can make the task significantly easier. A Video Camera can also be a powerful tool even in singleplayer, especially if the player cannot see the ghost well due to poor lighting or other reasons; the Camera screen will visibly display \"Ghost Shapeshift\" if it is pointed at the ghost when it shifts, immediately giving an Obake away. Another way to identify the Obake is by spotting its missing footstep sounds either in a sequence of 3+ steps after it stepped in a single salt pile, or during fake hunt/Music Box events. Both of these methods also work on zero-evidence runs. Additionally, in multiplayer, if a player doesn't hear the same number of footstep sounds than another player for one sequence, then it is an Obake. Note that there are difficulty settings that can change the default chance of a fingerprint being left on a surface, as well as the decay timer. Keep this in mind when playing on such custom difficulties. ==Trivia== *In Japanese folklore, an Obake (お化け), or sometimes \"Bakemono\" (化け物), is said to be a type of Yokai. Literally, the terms mean a thing that changes, referring to a state of transformation or shapeshifting. These words are often translated as \"ghost\", but primarily they refer to living things or supernatural beings who have taken on a temporary transformation, and these bakemono are distinct from the spirits of the dead. However, as a secondary usage, the term obake can be a synonym for Yurei, the ghost of a deceased human being. **In English, the ghost is referred to as a general, non-specified type of an Obake. However, if the language is set to Japanese, this ghost type is actually written as 化け狐 (Bake Kitsune), making this ghost specifically a fox Obake. *In a custom difficulty, the Obake's ability to halve the fingerprints' remaining duration also affects \"infinite\" fingerprints, as their actual duration is not infinite but rather 2,147,483,647 seconds (the maximum value of a signed Int32 data type, used to store integers), or approximately 68 years. This makes it possible for \"infinite\" fingerprints to disappear if one waits long enough and the Obake uses this ability often enough (around 25 times). ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !0.4.0 |Added Obake. |- !0.4.1.0 |Increased the chance of the Obake leaving fingerprints from 50% to 75%. |- !0.8.0 |The Obake now has a 1/15 (~6.67%) chance to appear as a different ghost model per flicker during hunts; will happen at least once per hunt |- |} == References == ru:Обакэ fr:Obake Category:Ghosts","title":"Obake","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Obake"}
{"content":"The Haunted Mirror is a cursed possession that can be used to locate the ghost's favorite room. ==Mechanics== A haunted mirror has a 1 in 7 chance per contract of being chosen as the cursed possession that will spawn on a default difficulty, with one specific spawn location per map. ===Activation and usage=== The mirror can be while inside the investigation area. It will be automatically deactivated when brought outside. When activated, the haunted mirror will show a view of the favorite room as a sweeping panorama from the center of the room, allowing players to locate the room by cross-reference. This view is a live feed of the room, so any lights turned on, items moved, and equipment or players present in the room will be visible. The only exception is the player's own model. The mirror also gives a faint glow to see into the favorite room, which all players, including the user, can see, even outside of the mirror. This can help confirm rooms, as well as help other players know where the favorite room is. Each usage of the haunted mirror, which includes the animation of raising but not of lowering the mirror, will decrease sanity at a rate of 7.5% per second, or by 20%, whichever is higher. This means that using the mirror for less than ~2.67 seconds will still drain at least 20% sanity. The mirror will crack visually and audibly, triggering a cursed hunt if: *The user's sanity reaches 0% while looking into the mirror *A player activates the mirror while below 20% sanity Once broken, the mirror automatically lowers and cannot be used for the rest of the investigation. ===Rewards=== Taking a photo of a haunted mirror, cracked or not, will yield a photo labelled as Haunted Mirror, and reward up to $7 and 7 XP, depending on the tier of the Photo Camera. ==Tips== *On maps such as Brownstone High School where many rooms look very similar, it may be hard to confirm the favorite room; players can place some equipment in the room they suspect to be the favorite room, and see if said equipment is visible in the mirror. Alternatively, players can also memorize small details such as the position and placement of windows, or the tile color, before searching that room. *If the \"Eye Adaption\" option is on, the player's vision will be significantly darkened for a short while after lowering down the mirror. Turn this option off if it becomes troublesome. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !0.5.0 |Added Haunted Mirror as a cursed possession. |- !0.5.0.2 |The mirror's view into the favourite room will now keep rotating instead of resetting on every use. |- !0.8.0.3 |The mirror now drains at least 20% sanity per use. |- !0.9.5.0 |The Haunted Mirror will now correctly break straight away if you do not have enough sanity (20%). |}<br> Category:Item fr:Miroir hanté ru:Зачарованное зеркало","title":"Haunted Mirror","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Haunted_Mirror"}
{"content":"The Poltergeist is a type of ghost in Phasmophobia. It is known for its constant disturbance of the environment around it, throwing items around with great force. ==Behaviour== ===Activity=== In general, the Poltergeist is more likely to throw items. During a hunt, the Poltergeist will always throw an item every 0.5 seconds, instead of only having a 50% chance to do so. The Poltergeist's throwing power is of 2 - 6 horizontally and 3 - 6 vertically, while it respectively of 1 - 3 and 1 - 5 for other ghosts. ===Ability=== The Poltergeist will occasionally use an ability that allows it to throw multiple nearby items at once, creating an EMF level 2 reading (the thrown items themselves generate EMF 3). This will decrease the sanity of all nearby players in line-of-sight with the EMF 2 location by 2% per item thrown. The Poltergeist can use this ability even while the lights in its current room are on. <center><gallery> File:Poltergeist Throw 1.gif|Direct throw variant File:Poltergeist Throw 2.gif|Levitation then throw variant File:Poltergeist Throw 3.gif|Levitation then drop variant File:Poltergeist Throw 4.gif|Levitation then throw towards player variant </gallery></center> If there are no items near a Poltergeist, it is unable to use its ability. This does not influence its behaviour towards initiating a hunt. ==Evidence== ==Strengths and weaknesses== These are the strengths and weaknesses as listed in the journal: Strength: Poltergeists can throw multiple objects at once, and with great force. Weakness: With nothing to throw, Poltergeists become powerless. ==Strategies== ===Identification=== Taking advantage of the Poltergeist's abilities, one can scatter multiple objects around in its room. If one object is seen being flung with force across the room, or multiple objects are thrown at once, then it is probably a Poltergeist. Note that there is some overlap of how hard regular ghosts can throw and how hard a Poltergeist can throw; this trait is harder to discern in small rooms. *It is generally better to build multiple small piles spread out rather than one large pile; if the Poltergeist is not near the pile, it will not affect the pile at all. It's important to be prudent when suspecting a Poltergeist, and not simply immediately guess it from inconclusive behavior; while it is generally quite active in regards to constantly throwing items, the largely random nature of interactions can cause other ghosts to toss items frequently, matching the activity levels of the Poltergeist at times, especially with more active ghost types like the Oni and Thaye. Likewise, low activity should also not discount the possibility of a Poltergeist. *Remember to turn off the lights to increase activity if attempting to identify it from its normal item throws. *Conversely, turning on lights may help with noticing its ability, as a Poltergeist can use it to throw items even when lights are on, while other ghosts cannot throw items in lit rooms; noticing items getting thrown in lit rooms, especially multiple at once, is a strong indicator of a Poltergeist. With that being said however, certain factors may cause red herrings when observing for this phenomenon, especially if only one object is affected : **Due to the range-based mechanic of ghost interactions, ghosts are technically capable of throwing objects through walls. This means that any ghost in a dark room can throw an item in an adjacent lit room if it is within its interaction range. Players should consider this and verify the ghost's current location before jumping to conclusions. **Make sure that the affected object came from a lit room, and was not thrown in from a neighboring unlit room. This is particularly important in rooms with no clear physical boundaries, such as the exterior areas of Camp Woodwind. The Poltergeist can also be identified during a hunt. By scattering multiple objects in the investigation area, one can witness the ghost's throwing strength and frequency. Witnessing a throw every 0.5 seconds may indicate a Poltergeist, and it will also throw items with a much stronger force, usually throwing items at high speeds across entire rooms or even between rooms; in Camp Woodwind for example, it is capable of throwing items near the entrance directly into the truck! ==Trivia== *A poltergeist is a type of ghost known for causing physical disturbances, such as loud noises and objects being moved or destroyed. Although claims of supernaturally-caused disturbances date back to the 1st century, references to poltergeists specifically became more common in the early 1600s. The word poltergeist comes from the German language words poltern (\"to make sound\" and \"to rumble\") and Geist (\"ghost\" and \"spirit\"), and the term itself translates as \"noisy ghost\", \"rumble-ghost\" or a \"loud spirit\". A synonym coined by René Sudre is thorybism, from Greek thorybein (\"to make noise or uproar; throw into confusion\"). *The Poltergeist's ability can drain sanity from dead players, making them having less sanity than before their death if they get revived. ==History== {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access Alpha |- !13 March 2020 |Replaced Bug evidence with Ghost Particle. |- !14 April 2020 |Poltergeists now have a chance to throw objects with more force than other ghost types. |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !0.3.0 |Prior to 0.3.0, the evidence was Spirit Box, Fingerprints, and Ghost Orb. |- !0.5.2.0 |Poltergeist’s ability will now reduce the sanity of all nearby players instead of just one player. |- !rowspan = \"2\"|0.7.0 |The Oni's throw ability has been moved to the Poltergeist. |- |The Poltergeist now has an increased rate of interacting with objects during a hunt. |- !0.9.4.0 |Ghost writing books can no longer be thrown by a poltergeist ability |} ==References== ru:Полтергейст fr:Poltergeist Category:Ghosts","title":"Poltergeist","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Poltergeist"}

Weakness: Oni disappear less often while hunting their prey. ==Strategies== With increased activity in general, the Oni may more readily give up evidence to players, which can make for generous and swift investigations if an Oni is quick to reveal the necessary evidence. Since the Oni cannot perform the mist form ghost event, an Oni can be ruled out if the ghost performs such an event. It must be emphasised that the Oni can hiss as part of a chasing event. A way to differentiate the chasing event is that you will hear the (random) ghost vocalisation and footsteps, and doors in the room will usually close (if any). Also, there are four hiss sounds that a mist form event cannot do; only one hiss sound is shared by mist form and chasing events. While not a particularly aggressive ghost, as the Oni is more likely to trigger ghost events against hunters, it may more rapidly bring the team down to hunt sanity threshold, especially when factoring in its doubled sanity reduction when colliding with players during ghost events. Depending on the circumstances, Sanity Medication can be used to counteract this loss, or defensive items like Incense can be brought in sooner. ==Trivia== *In Japanese folklore, an Oni (鬼) is a kind of demonic ogre or troll, and can be seen as a type of Yokai. They are usually portrayed as hulking figures with horns on their heads, sharp claws and tusks, an odd skin tone such as red, green, or blue, and carrying large iron clubs. In Phasmophobia, Oni do not reflect these depictions or their Japanese origin, and simply uses possible form of American ghost in both appearance and name due to sharing models and a naming pool with other ghost types. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access Alpha |- !August 5, 2020<br>(Part 2) |Added Oni. |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !0.3.0 |Prior to 0.3.0, the evidence was EMF Level 5, Spirit Box, and Ghost Writing. |- !rowspan=\"3\" |0.5.0 |Oni can no longer perform \"ghost mist\" ghost events. |- |Increased the average activity rate for Oni. |- |Oni now have a higher chance of showing in a full form if it manifests. |- !0.6.2.0 |The bugged airball that appears on certain maps will no longer appear if the ghost is an Oni. |- !rowspan=\"3\"|0.7.0 |The Oni's throw ability has been moved to the Poltergeist. |- |Onis will now double the sanity drain of normal ghosts during ghost events. |- |Increased the duration for the Oni to be visible during hunts. |} ==Notes== Category:Ghosts fr:Oni ru:Они","title":"Oni","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Oni"}
{"content":"The Obambo is a type of ghost in Phasmophobia. Its unique ability revolves around switching between a \"calm\" state in which it is less aggressive and slower during hunts and an \"aggressive\" state in which it is more aggressive and faster during hunts. ==Behavior== ===Activity=== The Obambo has two states: \"calm\" and \"aggressive\". It always starts in the calm state at the beginning of a contract before switching to the other state 1 minute after an exit door is opened for the first time, then every 2 minutes. The state switch can happen during a hunt. Depending on its state, the Obambo will either have very high activity or low activity, respectively when calm and aggressive. ===Hunt=== The Obambo has a hunt sanity threshold of 10% while in its calm state, and of 65% in its aggressive state. The Obambo will travel at a base speed of 1.445 m/s in its calm state and at a base speed of 1.955 m/s in its aggressive state. The hunt duration will be 20% shorter if the Obambo starts the hunt in the aggressive state. This will apply even if the ghost switches to the calm state mid-hunt. ==Evidence== ==Strengths and weaknesses== These are the strengths and weaknesses as listed in the journal: Strength: While aggressive, the Obambo is quicker to start hunting. Weakness: While calm, the Obambo is slower to start hunting and easier to track. ==Strategies== The Obambo can easily be mistaken for The Twins if one tries to identify the ghost only by its hunt speed, as they both have similar base speeds. A conclusive way to identify the Obambo is to time the duration of a hunt. If the ghost is faster than the standard speed at the beginning of the hunt and the hunt lasts 20% less time than expected, then it is an Obambo. It can also switch states (and thus its base speed) during a hunt, so if the ghost snaps from a slower speed to a faster speed (or vice versa) during a hunt, seemingly for no reason, then it is very likely an Obambo. ==Trivia== *An Obambo, also known as an Obambou, is a supernatural entity belonging to tribes of Central Africa. It is depicted as evil, possessing the power to do evil and good, if it chooses to, having the ability to possess and cause sickness. In some African tribes, an Obambou is referred to as a devil, or as the spirit of someone who was not buried correctly. The Commi tribe believed that when someone is severely ill, an Obambou is a likely culprit which can be determined by a doctor or shaman. The Obambo will reside in the bowels of humans until family, friends, and neighbors surround the possessed person and make noise however they can to drive out the Obambo, by singing, dancing, yelling, or banging things together. *With line-of-sight (LOS) acceleration, the Obambo can achieve a top speed of 3.23 m/s in its aggressive state, making it the joint second fastest ghost in the game behind the Moroi (3.71 m/s) and tied with the Gallu. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !0.15.1.0 |Added Obambo. |} fr:Obambo Category:Ghosts","title":"Obambo","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Obambo"}

{"content":"The Phantom is a type of ghost in Phasmophobia. It is known to drain the sanity of those that have sight of it during a manifestation. ==Behavior== ===Activity=== When capturing a photo/video of a Phantom, whether it be in its full form, translucent form, shadow form, or D.O.T.S state, the ghost will physically disappear (but remain in its previous state, e.g. a ghost event) once the capture is successful, and the resulting media will contain no visible ghost and no interference. *If the photo/video was taken during a ghost event, electronic equipment will also cease to malfunction and the player's heartbeats will stop playing. *If the photo/video was taken during a hunt, the ghost will briefly disappear before continuing to physically flash in and out. Being within 10 metres of a Phantom while in pseudo line-of-sight (where heartbeats play) reduces the player's sanity by 0.5%/s. This only applies during ghost events and hunts, and is separate from passive sanity drain. This does not apply during ghost events if the Phantom was made invisible by taking a picture. ===Ability=== The Phantom has an ability where it will choose a random player and travel to a spot within 5 metres of their location (as opposed to a regular roam). This will create an EMF Level 2 reading at the location where the roam ended, at the level of the targeted player's head when uncrouched. This behavior is somewhat similar to that of the Banshee and the Wraith; unlike Banshees, Phantoms do not select a player to target until they die or leave the game, and do not do this as often; and unlike Wraiths, the Phantom physically walks to that point rather than teleporting, and will set off Motion Sensors and disturb Salt on the way to it. ===Hunt=== During a hunt, the Phantom flickers and is on average visible for shorter and invisible for longer compared to most other ghosts: {| class=\"fandom-table\" !Ghost !Visibility length (s) !Invisibility length (s) !Total per-flicker length (s) |- |Phantom |0.08 - 0.30 |0.70 - 1.92 |1.00 - 2.00 |- |Standard ghost |0.08 - 0.30 |0.10 - 0.92 |0.30 - 1.00 |} ==Evidence== ==Strengths and weaknesses== These are the strengths and weaknesses as listed in the journal: Strength: Looking at a Phantom will drop your sanity considerably faster. Weakness: Taking a photo of the Phantom will make it temporarily disappear. ==Strategies== ===Identification=== A good way to identify a Phantom is to observe whether the ghost is invisible for longer intervals on average during hunts (more than 1 second); this will usually indicate a Phantom. Taking a photo of a Phantom is also a fair indicator; the Phantom will not be visible in the photo, and there will be no interference pattern on the photo. If the photo was taken during D.O.T.S or a ghost event, the ghost will also disappear from view. This can be done when the ghost appears in D.O.T.S, when it manifests during a ghost event, or during a hunt; Generally D.O.T.S will be the most reliable, as the ghost is visible less frequently during hunts making photos difficult (and observing its blinking behavior is already enough to identify a Phantom anyways), and ghost events can be quite rare. However, note that on reduced evidence difficulties, a Phantom is not guaranteed to have D.O.T.S as one of its evidence. *Note that occasionally, desync may cause the same effect if the picture is taken right at the end of the ghost event, even if the ghost is not a Phantom. This may make this semi-unreliable; checking with other players about whether the photo is completely clear may help you to arrive at a conclusion (though it is not definite). *This could also happen at the very end of a hunt. *This is better to do with a Summoning Circle or Music Box, since the \"ghost event grace period\" is generally fixed or predictable. *Taking photos of any ghost from a different floor will not produce interference, though for all other ghosts the ghost will still be visible. *Taking a photo of a Goryo during its D.O.T.S state will also produce no interference, and the ghost to be invisible on the picture. The Phantom's sanity-draining ability could be used to identify it, though this is rarely the main strategy used, as its sanity drain is gradual and not as dramatic as e.g. a Moroi or Jinn's sanity drain, and the player must discern normal sanity drain due to darkness/other factors, from the actual sanity drain caused by a Phantom. If activity (interactions or hunts) is noted in a room far away from its existing favourite room, and a player has recently been in that far-away room, then the ghosts could be narrowed down to a few ghosts, one of these being the Phantom. Note that some ghost events or custom difficulty settings make it normal for any ghost to move far away in this manner. On the other hand, this is more reliable on big maps, since ghost activity for a generic ghost is more likely to be confined to a small area relative to the map size. When it roams to a player, it will leave an EMF level 2 reading where the roam ended, and if the player notices such a reading appearing out of nowhere when there has been no interactions and/or the player is far from the ghost room, then it could be a Phantom. Keep in mind that Wraiths also exhibit this behavior; confirm that it is not a Wraith by placing Salt nearby or by checking whether the EMF reading is located at head level or at ground level using a Tier 3 EMF Reader. ===Survival=== Since the Phantom is visible much less frequently during hunts, it will be harder to track, and players may die as a result of not knowing exactly where it is in time. Specifically, it will be much harder (and not recommended) to loop the ghost, while blinding it using Incense must be treated with caution: stand at the end of a suitably long hallway, and smudge slightly earlier than one would normally do to avoid being caught off guard. Tracking the ghost by its hunting noises is also a considerable strategy when dealing with a Phantom. ==Trivia== *Etymology-wise, Phantom pulls from as early as Greece with the word φάντασμα, or phantasma, which stands for an apparition or a ghost. It could also be translated to something that is not real in general, like a dream or an illusion. As such, phantoms in most tales typically elaborate more on the concept of being an illusion version of something that already exists. The Phantom could be said to be a dream ghost. *Contrary to the journal's description, the Ouija Board is not related to the Phantom in any way gameplay-wise; contracts where the cursed possession is Ouija Board do not have a higher chance of the ghost being a Phantom and vice versa, and it has no relation to a Phantom's ability to wander to players. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access Alpha |- !6 March 2020 |Increased the amount of time during which Phantoms are invisible during hunts. |- !7 August 2020 |Visible Phantoms now drain sanity if the player is within line-of-sight nearby. |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !0.3.0 |Prior to 0.3.0, the evidence was EMF Level 5, Ghost Orb, and Freezing Temperatures. |} ==References== ==Notes== ru:Фантом fr:Fantôme Category:Ghosts","title":"Phantom","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Phantom"}
{"content":"Sanity is a value which determines a number of things during gameplay. Sanity usually begins at 100% at the start of a game and decreases as the game progresses. The lower the average sanity, the more likely a ghost is to perform certain actions. ==Mechanics== There are two main readings of sanity in the game: the individual sanity of each player, and the average team sanity of all players. These values can be read at any time on the truck's sanity monitor in all difficulty modes except Nightmare and Insanity, where the screen will be damaged and sanity readings do not function. Each player's displayed individual sanity fluctuate by up to ±2%, while the displayed average sanity has a larger fluctuation depending on the number of players. This fluctuation is only applied to the numbers shown on the screen in the truck, and the actual value used for the game's calculations does not have this fluctuation applied. For example, if a 3-player game has an actual average sanity of 65%, the displayed average sanity will fluctuate between 59% to 71%. At the start of the contract, once an exit door has been opened, players' sanities will begin to be able to drop. Sanity affects things like interactions, ghost events, hunts, and flickering lights; lower average sanity results in increasing relative frequency of such paranormal activity, though as there is a high degree of randomness in these occurrences to begin with, this may not always be readily apparent over the course of an investigation. Individual sanities are not taken into account for these effects in most cases, meaning that a player with a high sanity level going inside may still face more aggressive behavior from the ghost if their partners staying outside all have near zero sanity. Dead players' sanities are not included when calculating the average team sanity. All ghosts have a specific hunt sanity threshold below which they will be able to attempt a hunt. The Banshee is the only ghost which uses its target's sanity to decide whether to hunt, while other effects still use average sanity. When a player reaches 0% sanity, nothing noteworthy occurs, save for the completion of the \"Reach 0 sanity\" Daily Task if available and not yet completed that day. Sanity cannot go into the negatives. ===Passive drain=== Whether passive sanity drain is applied depends on the status of the lights in the room. In most rooms, sanity drain will be prevented by turning on all of their \"main lights\", these generally being ceiling light sources controlled by wall switches, rather than lamps or televisions, of which will still provide visibility when turned on but will not block sanity drain. In larger rooms with multiple dark spots (e.g. most hallways in Sunny Meadows Mental Institution), sanity drain will not be blocked entirely even with the lights on, but will instead be reduced to 80% of the normal rate. Additionally, being near a firelight will reduce sanity drain by a variable percentage based on the tier of the item, even if the room's lights are off. Examples of situations that will not prevent passive sanity drain include: *Holding a lit flashlight of any type *Standing in front of an active computer, even though it technically counts as a light source *Turning up the game's brightness Protections against passive sanity drain do not apply to other types of drains. ====Drain rates==== The table below lists the drain rates when the \"main lights\" are off: {| class=\"fandom-table\" !Map size !Drain during Setup Phase (%/s) !Normal drain (%/s) |- !Small |0.09 |0.12 |- !Medium |0.05 |0.08 |- !Large |0.03 |0.05 |}<br>The values above are multiplied depending on the difficulty: *1x rate of decay for Amateur. *1.5x rate of decay for Intermediate. *2x rate of decay for Professional, Nightmare, and Insanity. *0x - 2x rate of decay for Custom. The multipliers above are increased by 1 if playing with Blood Moon weather. Playing solo will further halve the rate of sanity drain. ===Ghost-related drains=== *When a player dies, all other living players will lose 15% sanity. Ghosts can drain the player's sanity in several ways: *For all ghosts, if the target for most ghost events (not to be confused with a Banshee target) collides with the ghost or smoke ball, causing it to disappear, that player loses 10% of their sanity. **If the Banshee performs a singing event on its hunt target and they collide with the ghost in this manner, they lose 15% sanity instead. **Colliding with the Oni during any form of ghost event deducts 20% sanity instead. *The Jinn will occasionally use an ability that drains the sanity of a nearby player by 25%, which can only be used if the breaker is turned on. *The Yurei will occasionally use an ability that closes a door in its room and drains the sanity of all nearby players by 15%, which can only be used if there is at least one opened door in its room. *Being cursed by the Moroi, caused by a response on the parabolic microphone or Spirit Box, causes the player to double their passive sanity drain, and lights will not negate this sanity drain nor will Firelights lower it. *Being within 10 metres of a manifested Phantom while in pseudo line-of-sight (where heartbeats play) further drops the player's sanity at a rate of approximately 0.5%/s. *When the Poltergeist uses its ability to throw multiple items, the sanity of nearby players will decrease by 2% times the number of objects thrown. ===Equipment sanity gain/loss=== Sanity can be directly gained or lost through certain equipment: *Sanity Pills: Restores between 0% to 100% of individual sanity depending on the difficulty over a period of time. *Haunted Mirror: Each usage costs 20% sanity or 7.5% per second, whichever is higher. *Monkey Paw: Using I wish to be sane sets all players' sanities to 50%, and increases the passive sanity drain rate by 50%. Using any weather wish reduces sanity by 25%. *Music Box: Being within 2.5 metres of an active music box drains sanity by 2.5% per second. *Ouija Board: Each question asked deducts a certain amount of sanity from the player, depending on the type of question. *Summoning Circle: Each candle lit deducts 16% sanity from nearby players. *Tarot Cards: Drawing the card The Sun restores the player's sanity to 100%, while drawing the card The Moon drains the player's sanity completely, setting it at 0%. In addition, The Wheel of Fortune, can either add 25% sanity (if the card burns green), or deduct 25% (if the card burns red). *Voodoo Doll: Each pin deducts 5% sanity, except for the heart pin which deducts 10%. ===Protections=== *During the Setup Phase, sanity cannot go below 50%, regardless of the source of sanity drain. ==Objectives== *Get an average sanity below 25% ==Tasks== *Reach 0 sanity ($50/50 XP) ==Related difficulty settings== *Starting sanity: Each member's starting sanity *Sanity pill restoration (%): The amount of sanity restored per 'Sanity Pills' *Sanity drain speed (%): The rate your sanity decreases while standing in the dark ==Trivia== *Previously, witnessing a ghost manifestation, humming, or whispering increased sanity by 25%. This was a known bug which was fixed in Post Launch Update #3. *Internally, insanity is used for some mechanics, instead of looking directly at sanity. Insanity is simply 100% - sanity. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access Alpha |- !30 January 2020 |Decreased the rate of passive sanity drain. |- !4 February 2020 |More fake ghost sounds will play the lower the sanity an individual player has. |- !6 Februrary 2020 |Increased the rate of passive sanity drain. |- !10 March 2020 |Sanity sounds can no longer be heard by dead players. |- !23 March 2020 |Decreased the rate of passive sanity drain again. |- !11 April 2020 |Sanity no longer decays before any exit door is opened. |- !7 July 2020 |Sanity no longer decays outside the building. |- !21 August 2020 |Decreased the rate of passive sanity drain in medium and large maps. |- !25 August 2020 |Further decreased the rate of passive sanity drain in medium and large maps. |- !11 September 2020 |Removed fake ghost sounds caused by low sanity. |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !19 September 2020<br>(Part 3) |Playing on singleplayer now halves passive sanity drain. |- !0.174 |Lights will now flicker for individual players at lower sanity. |- ! rowspan=\"3\" |0.9.0.9 |Sanity drain from darkness has been reworked; the drain is now based on the status of the lights in the room rather than the amount of light surrounding the player.

{"content":"The Sanity Monitor is a screen in the truck labelled \"Team Sanity\". It reads both the sanity of individual players as well as the average sanity of the team, both expressed as a percentage. The Sanity Monitor is not perfectly accurate, as it will oscillate by +/-2% in order for sanity to be perceived as more organic. Despite this inherent inaccuracy, it is still critical to gleaming player sanity levels, and by that extent seeing how aggressive the ghost will be; as average sanity decreases, hunts will occur with increasing frequency. The player will always view themselves as the first person listed on the monitor, followed by any other players in the order that they loaded into the map. Players who are yet to load into the map show up on the Sanity Monitor with their name shown as \"Loading...\", and a hyphen in place of their sanity. Dead players will have their sanity value replaced with a \"?\" instead. Players who have left the game will disappear from the sanity monitor entirely. In Nightmare and Insanity difficulties, the Sanity Monitor is damaged, and will give random readings, becoming essentially useless. Use of an Ouija Board, if available, is thus the only feasible way to get a good estimate of one's current sanity.

{"content":"Salt is a purchasable item used to place salt piles. Ghosts can step in the salt pile, which can be used to check for Ultraviolet evidence. ==Usage== A salt container can be used to salt piles on the floor. Each salt container can be used 2-3 times, allowing a maximum of 6-9 salt piles to be placed per game with 3 salt containers. Salt piles can be stacked in the same spot. When a ghost walks over a salt pile, it will leave an indent in the pile. This can happen any time, regardless of the ghost being invisible or not. Within the next few seconds after the salt has been stepped in, when the ghost moves, it will create audible footsteps (similar to footsteps during a hunt), and if it has Ultraviolet evidence, it will also leave temporary footprints visible under UV light where it chooses to roam. Wraiths and enraged Gallus will never leave any imprint on salt piles, walking over them as if they do not exist. Players cannot leave an imprint in salt piles or generate footprints. ===Tier I=== The Tier I salt shaker has two uses, and places a small, circular pile of white salt on the ground. A sole-like imprint will be left in the pile once a ghost steps over it. ===Tier II=== The Tier II salt jar has three uses, and places a long pile of pink salt, making it easier for the ghost to step on. The middle of the salt pile will disappear when the ghost steps on it. ===Tier III=== The Tier III salt jar has three uses, and places a long pile of black salt, identical in size to Tier II salt. If the ghost steps on a black salt pile during a hunt, its speed will be reduced by 50% for 2 seconds. If it steps on another black salt pile before the 2 seconds are over, the timer will be reset but the ghost will not be further slowed down. If the ghost steps on the salt pile outside of a hunt, it will turn around and go back the way it came briefly. It has no effect during ghost events. As Wraiths and enraged Gallus ignore salt entirely, none of these effects will apply to them even if they physically pass through it. ===Rewards=== Filming a salt pile being disturbed will yield a Disturbed Salt video, rewarding up to $12 and 12 XP depending on the tier of the Video Camera and whether there is a Unique stamp. ==Tips== *If placed strategically, salt can be used to track exactly where the ghost is walking after it has been located, potentially to the players' advantage. *Placing salt close to external corners in wide hallways or rooms with acute angles will maximize the chances of the ghost stepping in the salt. This is because the ghost is programmed to take the shortest route to its next waypoint when wandering, therefore it is more likely to navigate by hugging corners and other turns. *Dropping a UV Light near the salt pile will illuminate any footprints present without having to hold the UV light. *Using tier III salt can help in taking ghost photos during hunts as it slows down the ghost. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access Alpha |- !? | Added salt. |- !25 March 2020 |Salt can now be placed on the ground. |- !1 April 2020 |Changed the salt pile model to 3D, which will flatten when a ghost walks in it. |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !22 September 2020 |Wraiths no longer interact with salt during hunts. |- !? |Ghosts can no longer disturb salt during hunts. |- !0.3.0 |Changed the salt pile and salt shaker models. |- !0.6.2.0 |Increased the limit of salt shakers per contract from 2 to 3. |- !0.8.0 |Wraiths no longer interact with salt at all. |- ! rowspan=\"3\" |0.9.0 |Salt now has 3 tiers. |- |Salt will now only reveal footprints if the ghost has Ultraviolet evidence. |- |Ghosts can now disturb salt piles during hunts. |}<br> Category:Equipment fr:Sel ru:Соль","title":"Salt","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Salt"}
{"content":"The Onryo is a type of ghost in Phasmophobia. The Onryo is noted to be wary of fire; however, when the fires go out, beware its vengeance, for an Onryo may decide to hunt once there are no flames keeping it at bay. ==Behaviour== ===Activity=== The Onryo's flame blowing frequency increases the more dead players there are: {| class=\"fandom-table\" !Number of dead players !Chance of blowing out the flame !Chance of blowing out the tier II firelight !Cooldown before the Onryo can attempt to blow out the flame after lighting (not first lighting) |- |0 |66.67% |96.3% |20 - 80 seconds |- |1 |75% |98.43% |20 - 60 seconds |- |2 |80% |99.2% |20 - 40 seconds |- |3 |83.33% |99.54% |20 seconds |}<br>The Onryo cannot light any fire sources (fireplaces, campfires, and candles) naturally, but can be forced into doing so with a Voodoo Doll. Contrary to the journal's description, flames do not make the Onryo more likely to leave a room. ===Ability=== Counterintuitively, flames can both prevent hunts and cause a hunt: *If the Onryo attempts a hunt within 4 metres of any type of flame (e.g. firelight, igniter, campfire, etc.), it will blow out the flame instead, and the hunt will fail. This does not restart the hunt cooldown timer, unlike a crucifix. If both a crucifix and a flame are within range, the flame will take priority over the crucifix for preventing the hunt. **The Onryo's hunt attempts also override a flame's individual cooldowns, making it capable of blowing out a firelight within 30 seconds of its first lighting, or within 20 seconds of its subsequent lightings. Note that a tier III firelight's current cooldown is paused if it is turned off by the player or an Onryo's hunt attempt. *Every third flame that the Onryo blows out will cause it to attempt to initiate a hunt, regardless of current average sanity. This hunt can be blocked by normal prevention methods (e.g. a crucifix) or another flame. **Note that there can be a delay of up to 6 seconds before the hunt actually initiates. **A flame preventing a hunt or blown out during a hunt will count towards the three-flame rule. **Whether it was the same item being blown out does not matter; it can be the same firelight blown out 3 times, 3 firelights each blown out 1 time, or any other combination. **If the third flame is blown out during a hunt or an Incense's cleansing effect, the hunt attempt will be canceled. However, if the third flame is blown out during a hunt cooldown or a ghost event, the Onryo will use its ability at the end of the cooldown or the event. Consequently, there are several situations (non-exhaustive) which might occur: *One firelight and one crucifix is within range of the Onryo, and it blows out the firelight as its third flame. The ability is triggered, but the crucifix will prevent the hunt, losing one charge. *One firelight and one <u>lit igniter</u> is within range of the Onryo, and it blows out the firelight as the third flame. The igniter will prevent the hunt and be blown out. *One firelight is within range of the Onryo, and it attempts to hunt naturally. The firelight prevents the hunt and is blown out. ===Hunt=== The Onryo has a hunt sanity threshold of 60% by default. When it is near a flame, this threshold is decreased to 40%. ==Evidence== ==Strengths and weaknesses== These are the strengths and weaknesses as listed in the journal: Strength: Extinguishing a flame can cause an Onryo to attack. Weakness: When threatened, this ghost will be less likely to hunt. ==Strategies== The Onryo's aversion to fire, while a powerful tool against it, does come with risks of its own. However, with sufficient firelights and diligent relighting of them whenever they're extinguished, the Onryo may be kept from hunting indefinitely, which may also serve as identification for the ghost on reduced evidences difficulties. On the other hand, only having one lit firelight within range of it increases the risk of it hunting as a result of blowing it out if said firelight is being re-lit, or other flame sources are being activated nearby. The latter is even riskier if one or more players have died, as the Onryo will blow out firelights in increasing frequency. Players should consider whether having flames lit near the ghost is worth it to prevent hunts, or if they should be disregarded outright and simply play around the Onryo's heightened hunt threshold. ===Identification=== The Onryo can be tested using several ways, by looking for flame priority, preventing hunts with flames, or the three-flame rule: *Place one crucifix in the ghost's area, then a firelight directly on top. **Note that this is less reliable with Tier II or III crucifixes as they have a range that is greater than or equal to the flame range. *Place two crucifixes in the ghost's area, then multiple firelights spread out and covering the crucifixes' ranges. When sanity is deemed low enough, keep the firelights lit in a timely manner. *If the crucifix is activated without the firelights going out first, then it is not an Onryo. *If the ghost seems to not hunt with multiple firelights active, or hunts in an area where no firelights are lit, then it may be an Onryo. Due to the Onryo's hunt prevention mechanics, having a flame blown out within 30 seconds of its first lighting, or within 20 seconds of its subsequent lightings (or an igniter's first lighting), confirms an Onryo. This also makes the Onryo the only ghost that can blow out a tier I igniter's match, which only lasts 10 seconds. Keep in mind that tier III firelights pause the current cooldown if they are turned off by a player or an Onryo's hunt attempt. The third method is to keep track of the number of <u>flames</u> the ghost blows out, and observe whether the ghost tries to hunt every third flame. In Sunny Meadows, several lit candles can be found in the chapel, which ghosts can blow out. If the ghost is located there and hunts very early (and is otherwise not a Demon), then it may be an Onryo. The Onryo can be ruled out if the ghost lights up a fire source such as a fireplace, a campfire, or a candle. The Onryo is one of two ghosts (the other being the Hantu) for which you can collect all three pieces of evidence without excluding The Mimic. Therefore, before concluding you're dealing with an Onryo, confirm it using the methods mentioned above and/or check whether the ghost leaves Ultraviolet evidence. If it does, you have The Mimic instead. ==Trivia== *In Japanese mythology Onryō (怨霊, meaning 'vengeful spirit') are the spirits of people who died bearing some form of hatred for the living. Unlike the game version, they could cause fires and had no specific weakness to it. *Onryō have been popularised in modern times by the J-Horror genre with TV, films, and books series such as Ju-On (The Grudge) and Ringu (Ring). *Goryō are normally catagorised under Onryō in most Japanese texts since they are spirits that seek some form of vengence against the living. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !0.4.0 |Added Onryo. |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |0.9.4.1 |Smudge Sticks now block the Onryo's hunt ability |- |If the Onryo is hunting and blows out a third candle, it will now cancel the Onryo hunt ability and no longer start a hunt after that hunt ends |} ==References== ru:Онрё fr:Onryo Category:Ghosts","title":"Onryo","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Onryo"}
{"content":"10 Ridgeview Court (or simply Ridgeview) is a small map in Phasmophobia. A two-story, four-bedroom house with a garage and basement, Ridgeview presents a spacious living area, giving way to more congested linear hallways. However, the presence of closets and multiple sub-rooms to dive into provides plenty of safety during a hunt. ==Structure== Ridgeview has four bedrooms, four toilets, a garage and a basement, among other rooms. ===Layout tips=== *The \"Master Bedroom\" consists of the bedroom itself, the attached bathroom, and the closet that can be accessed through said bathroom. *The small hallway leading to \"Master Bedroom\" is considered part of \"Kitchen\". *The Upstairs Hallway includes both the main hallway that turns a corner and leads to \"Boys Bedroom\" and \"Bathroom\" and the straight hallway partially separated by a wall that leads to \"Teen Boys Bedroom\", \"Girls Bedroom\", and \"Upstairs Toilet\". *In order to fully prevent passive sanity drain in the Foyer, the light switch that turns on the lamp outside at the entrance door has to be turned on as well. *There is a bug where the computer in Hallway needs to be turned on to prevent passive sanity drain in that room. See Third-party tools for a list of detailed map viewers that players may use. ===Key hiding spots and strategies=== There are 10 \"sanctioned\" hiding spots in Ridgeview: *Living Room, behind stacked storage crates in corner by fireplace *Garage, lockers near entrance door *Garage, lockers along far wall *Basement, lockers directly across from door *Basement, behind stacked storage crates in corner (after entering and turning left twice) *Master Bedroom, behind storage crates in walk-in closet *Upstairs Hallway, closet at top of stairs *Upstairs Hallway, closet between boy's bedroom and bathroom *Upstairs Hallway, closet between girl's bedroom and teen boy's bedroom *Boy's Bedroom, closet across from bed Depending on the difficulty, a number of these hiding spots will be randomly blocked by bulky items or have the concealing elements removed, preventing players from hiding in them: *Amateur: None *Intermediate: 5 *Professional: 7 *Nightmare/Insanity: 8 *3-player game: +1 available hiding spot *4-player game: +2 available hiding spots <small>Additional hiding spots on multiplayer is overridden when \"Number of hiding places\" is set to None</small> Several more unofficial furniture-based hiding spots are available such as: *Kitchen, behind the fridge *Hallway, behind the piano or the computer Looping the ghost may be performed around the dining table. The ghost can also be looped around multiple shelves in the Basement (the collection of shelves on the right side opposite one of the Fuse Box locations is the easiest spot). ==Bone locations== Bones spawn randomly, but will only spawn in areas that a ghost can also walk on. ;Examples <div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\"><gallery widths=\"185\"> Bone Ridgeview diningroom.png|A bone under a chair in the dining room that may be easily missed.

{"content":"\"The most common way of accidentally summoning a ghost is with a Ouija Board, so you may come across these during your investigations. Be careful if you choose to use it as they have been known to lower your sanity. To use one, activate it and then ask a question with your voice.\" The Ouija Board is a cursed possession in Phasmophobia. It can be used to communicate with the ghost at the cost of sanity. ==Mechanics== A Ouija Board has a 1 in 7 chance per contract of being chosen as the cursed possession that will spawn, with one specific spawn location per map. A Ouija Board can be with an empty hand. Swapping to another item will cause the Ouija Board to drop from the inventory. ===Activation=== The Ouija Board can be activated by with it if the player is not holding it, or it directly while holding the board. The planchette will drop down onto the board, signifying that the board has been activated. There is currently a bug where an ongoing setup phase will only be canceled if a valid phrase has been recognized and not upon activation of the board. ===Questioning=== Players can choose to either use voice chat or a text-based UI to ask questions. *If using voice chat, once activated, the Ouija Board will respond to voice input within 5 meters of it. *If using the text-based UI, the UI will appear upon activation. Players can then click to select one of 3 categories, then select a category-specific question, or say goodbye. The player cannot exit the UI without saying goodbye or the board breaking, but the board can be thrown out while holding it. The player asking the question must be within the investigation area to ask questions, but does not have to be in the ghost room (nor the ghost's current room). If the question is recognized, the planchette will move to answer the question, and an EMF Level 2 reading will be generated around the Ouija Board. If the ghost has EMF Level 5 as evidence, there is a 33% chance for it to appear per question asked. Whether a ghost is \"shy\" or not does not affect its ability to respond through the Ouija Board. If the Ouija Board is asked a question but nothing happens, then either the board is not activated or the phrase was not recognized. There is a cooldown of ~2.5 seconds for clicking via text-based UI, while there is no cooldown time for voice chat, aside from any voice recognition limitations. ===Deactivation=== To deactivate the Ouija Board, any nearby player must say \"Goodbye\", which will make the planchette disappear. The Ouija Board can then be left alone safely. The Ouija Board will also deactivate automatically if the player holds the board and exits the investigation area. The Ouija board will burn and break apart, initiating a cursed hunt, if: *There is no player within 5 meters of a still-active board (leaving this range applies) *The player currently asking questions has less sanity than required to \"pay\" for the question *The phrase \"hide and seek\" (or similar) is said (see Questions) ===Rewards=== Using a Photo Camera to take a photo of the Ouija Board will yield a photo labelled as Ouija Board, and reward up to $7 and 7 XP. When the ghost answers a question by moving the planchette, a Ouija Board video and a Ouija Board sound can be captured using a Video Camera and a Sound Recorder. Each of these pieces of media will reward up to $7 and 7 XP. ==Questions== There are at least 13 different types of questions (including two jokes) that can be asked: *Location *Proximity *Age *Death *Room count *Sanity *Method of death *Bone location *Hide and seek *Feeling *Purpose *Joke *Shyness Note that if a question does not get a response, it is not considered a valid question.

{"content":"The Prison is a medium map in Phasmophobia, the second of its size type to be added to the game. The Prison bears a dilapidated, spartan environment, with long corridors subdivided with metal bars that make encounters with ghosts unnerving. ==Structure== Prison contains a variety of rooms, including two prison blocks containing all the jail cells, offices of various types, an infirmary room, visitation rooms, and more. Though slightly smaller than Brownstone High School, the Prison can be just as dangerous: a safe location during a hunt may be a great distance away, demanding a long run, compounded with the ghost's favourite room being able to be located in many areas that have only one or two routes of escape, including congested catwalks and entire cell block floors. Incense may be essential for survival in these situations, especially against ghosts with a speed advantage. Many parts of the building have light switches located in nearby separate rooms, requiring players to head away from them to manipulate the location's lighting. This can occasionally cause confusion with the ghost manipulating switches that illuminate other rooms. ===Layout tips=== *There are exit doors at the end of both prison blocks that lead into an outdoor courtyard, providing an alternative access route. This outside area also prevents passive sanity drain. *Each cell block consists of 5 distinct rooms. The first floor consists of three rooms: the left row of prison cells, the right row of prison cells including the small control room, and the open area in between, which includes the area up to the inner steel gates. The second floor consists of two rooms, split evenly down the middle with each row of cells in one room. *The computer keyboards in the cell block control rooms control the lights for the entire cell block. *The two upstairs rooms with hospital beds (separated by a single door) are considered by the game as one room called \"Infirmary\". *The upstairs room named \"Infirmary Hallway\" consists of 4 smaller \"sub-rooms\", including the small hallway leading to \"Cafeteria Security\" and the small room that may spawn a fuse box. *The rooms called Main Hallway and Office Hallway cannot be chosen as a ghost room. *The light switch for the Main Hallway is found in the Central Control room. *The following rooms count as dark rooms and hence will drain sanity with 80% of the rate, even with all room lights being on: **Entrance, Main Hallway, Cafeteria and Office Hallway. See Third-party tools for a list of detailed map viewers that players may use. ===Key hiding spots and strategies=== There are 4 \"sanctioned\" hiding spots in Prison: *Entrance, lockers at the far back of the room *Cafeteria, behind multiple garbage cans on the left (only if there are 4 garbage cans) *Infirmary, lockers at the far right end of the first room *Cafeteria Security, on the balcony area, behind two garbage cans, directly on the right when coming from the inside area Depending on the difficulty, some of these hiding spots may be blocked by the presence of bulky items or their concealing elements removed: *Amateur: None *Intermediate: 1 *Professional: 2 *Nightmare/Insanity: 3 *3-player game: +1 available hiding spot *4-player game: +2 available hiding spots <small>Additional hiding spots on multiplayer is overridden when \"Number of hiding places\" is set to None</small> ==Tips for surviving hunts== See also: Guides/Surviving a hunt *Due to the extremely limited hiding spots especially relative to the map's huge size, players should have an escape route ready, and be on the lookout and ready to run as soon as a hunt starts; if escaping from their current position isn't feasible e.g. in the Cafeteria which is nearly impossible to escape before the grace period ends, players should have Incense handy to protect themselves. *If the player is near the cell blocks when a hunt begins, the cells are actually relatively safe despite looking like awful hiding spots on paper, as the ghost cannot see through cell walls (though if one is unlucky, the ghost can still randomly wander into a cell and kill the player there); this even allows the player to observe the ghost's hunt behavior freely to try and identify it. *Due to the map's large size, a true hiding spot might not even be needed, and oftentimes it is simply enough to sit in a room far away from the ghost, as it's extremely unlikely the ghost will wander to your location just by chance if it hasn't detected you; a tier III Parabolic Microphone can be used to keep track of the ghost's location to ensure this doesn't happen (or give you ample warning to run if it does happen). *While not as secure as official hiding spots, there are some unofficial hiding spots that can work decently well, especially since these spots are always available unlike official hiding spots which may be blocked off; some examples include: **Behind some lockers in the Infirmary Hallway, near a possible fuse box location **Behind the large chair in the Warden's Office **Behind the large chair in the Chief Security Office **In a corner behind a table in the Main Office **Inside stalls in the Office Toilet **Behind some lockers in Inspection **Behind some lockers in Visitation Security ==Bone locations== Every contract, one bone will spawn randomly in the ghost's navmesh (where the ghost is able to walk). ;Examples <div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\"><gallery widths=\"240\"> Bone prison visitationsecurity.jpg|A bone in Visitation Security.

More Penitentiary\" as indicated on a sign above the front door and a notice sign in Entrance. *Prison has the second least amount of official hiding spots in the game, totaling only four across the entire map (the map with the least being Brownstone High School). However, like Brownstone High School, some rooms have usable unofficial hiding spots (e. g. behind shelves, tables or in cells/toilet stalls). *The assets for this map can be found here. *The light switch in the control room located on the bottom right of each cell block counts as a main room light (for sanity drain prevention) for the hallway of that cell block, and not for the row of cells. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !0.2 |Prison was added to the game.

{"content":"The Moroi is a type of ghost in Phasmophobia. Its ability to \"curse\" players to lower their Sanity, combined with its increased speed at low sanity levels, can cause it to become the fastest ghost in the game. ==Behaviour== ===Ability=== The Moroi has an ability to \"curse\" a target through the following ways: *By successfully obtaining a response from the Spirit Box; this will curse the person who \"caused\" the response, either by asking questions or triggering the failsafe. *By hearing paranormal sounds through the Parabolic Microphone. *By successfully recording any sound with the Sound Recorder. When a player is cursed, their passive sanity drain is doubled and being in a lit area will no longer prevent sanity drain (i.e. the player is considered in the dark at all times). Leaving the investigation area will still pause the sanity drain, and firelights will still mitigate the sanity drain. Consuming Sanity Medication removes the curse for that player. Players that have been cursed before in the contract can be cursed again. Multiple players can be cursed at the same time, but curses do not stack on a single player. ===Hunt=== The Moroi's speed is dependent on the average sanity, and will change during a hunt according to the current average sanity. The base speed increases by an average of 0.083 m/s for every 5% average sanity below its average hunt threshold of 50%. The list below shows each possible base speed for the Moroi: {| class=\"article-table\" |+ !Average sanity % !Base ghost speed |- |≥ 45% |1.5 m/s |- |40% - 45% |1.583 m/s |- |35% - 40% |1.66 m/s |- |30% - 35% |1.749 m/s |- |25% - 30% |1.832 m/s |- |20% - 25% |1.915 m/s |- |15% - 20% |1.998 m/s |- |10% - 15% |2.081 m/s |- |5% - 10% |2.164 m/s |- |0% - 5% |2.25 m/s |} When using an Incense during a hunt, the duration where the Moroi cannot see nor kill players is 7.5 seconds instead of 5. ==Strengths and weaknesses== These are the strengths and weaknesses as listed in the journal: Strength: The weaker their victims, the stronger the Moroi becomes. Weakness: Moroi suffer from hyperosmia, weakening them for longer periods. ==Evidence== On limited evidence (1/2 evidence) games, the Moroi will always have Spirit Box as one of its evidence types. ==Strategies== Given the Moroi's ability to drain sanity after responding through the Spirit Box, it is recommended to refrain from utilizing the Spirit Box after obtaining the first response. If necessary, only the player who previously asked questions should use the Spirit Box again. Usage of Parabolic Microphones should also be limited, and if required for an objective, should also be done by the player that previously used the Spirit Box. The Moroi only curses the player through a Sound Recorder if the paranormal sound is recorded, not if you hear it; it's possible to avoid getting cursed by stopping the recording prematurely or turning off the Sound Recorder before the sound is recorded, if one wishes to preserve their sanity. Due to the Moroi's ever increasing speed the lower the player's sanity drops, managing sanity levels is more important than ever; Sanity Medication should be used as soon as possible after a player finds out they have been cursed, lights should be kept on where possible, and in dark rooms (where lights don't stop sanity drain completely), or if the player cannot turn on lights due to any reason (limited by the fuse box, lights broken by ghost event etc), Firelights should be used judiciously to slow down sanity drain. ===Identification=== The easiest way to identify a Moroi is by paying attention to the ghost's speed: *Listen for the ghost's speed both over multiple hunts and during a given hunt, as average sanity lowers; a ghost that speeds up over the course of multiple hunts as average sanity lowers, or gradually speeds up during wandering when all players are hiding, could be a Moroi. Remember to take into account line-of-sight acceleration, if applicable. Note that the Hantu will increase in speed if the fuse box is left off as the temperature in the map decreases, but it does not speed up through line-of-sight; either keep the fuse box turned on to avoid misidentification, or make sure that the ghost does not have the Hantu's signature freezing breath during a chase with the power off. *As an alternate strategy, methods to quickly manipulate sanity can be utilized during a hunt. As the Moroi's roaming speed changes in real time as average sanity changes, a significant change of it (via Sanity Medication, or some cursed possessions which can quickly drop sanity) while it's hunting will cause the Moroi to abruptly speed up or slow down, potentially identifying it in the span of a single hunt. All players should be hidden (or, most optimally, having been hidden from the start) to avoid the speed change being confused for some other natural speed changes e.g. a ghost's acceleration/deceleration from line-of-sight or the Revenant's losing track of players, and to wait a few seconds in order to get a read on its roaming speed before using the cursed possession/Sanity Medication afterwards. **Additionally, a marked degree of coordination in multiplayer is required, as a single player's sanity changing will not affect the average sanity as much; players will have to e.g. use Sanity Medication at the same time, or take turns asking questions to a Ouija Board, in order to change average sanity enough to cause the Moroi to exhibit a definitive speed change. **A few other ghosts may change speeds even without seeing a player (Raiju when near electronics, Hantu roaming between different-temperature rooms); make sure the ghost isn't changing speeds on its own before performing the test. *If starting a cursed hunt early during the contract, especially with cursed possessions that can cause cursed hunts without draining sanity, it is extremely likely that the average sanity will be above 45% and the Moroi's roaming speed will be its minimum 1.5 m/s, noticeably slower than most ghosts. Keep in mind The Twins will have a base speed of 1.5 m/s when starting a hunt at its present location, which is indistinguishable from a Moroi's speed when above 45% sanity. Another way to identify the Moroi is by smudging it during a hunt. The Moroi will be blinded for 7.5 seconds instead of 5; noticing a blinding time longer than usual can indicate a Moroi. This will be more easily noticeable with Tier II and Tier III Incense as they affect the ghost's speed, causing a change in its footsteps during the blinding effect. When the sanity monitor is available, one can also identify a Moroi based on its ability: if your sanity has drained much more than normal after a Spirit Box response, a paranormal sound on the parabolic microphone, or a sound record with the sound recorder, especially if you've been in fully lit rooms and/or holding a Firelight for extended periods of time, then you have most likely been cursed by a Moroi. Take into account sanity drain from ghost events, if any, as well as if you have used any cursed possessions throughout the mission. ==Trivia== *The moroi (plural idem) are a type of vampires in Romanian folklore who practiced vampirism while being still alive (as opposed to strigoi who became vampires after death). In modern usage, moroi simply means \"ghost\" in Romanian. *Unlike most other ghosts with speed bonuses, the Moroi accelerates with continuous line-of-sight of a player. Below 5% average sanity, the maximum speed of a Moroi is 3.71 m/s, making it the fastest ghost in the game. *The Moroi is the ghost with the fastest potential speed in the game, reaching a staggering 6.4 m/s speed under the following conditions: **The ghost speed is set to 150% **The weather is Blood Moon **Average sanity is 0-5% **Continuous LoS for at least 13 seconds ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !0.6.2.0 |Added Moroi. |- !0.8.0.6 |The Moroi's speed now changes when the average sanity moves into a different bracket. |- !0.9.0 |Incense will now have an extra 50% duration against Moroi. |} ==References== ==Notes== Category:Ghosts fr:Moroï ru:Морой","title":"Moroi","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Moroi"}
{"content":"The Shade is a type of ghost in Phasmophobia. Noted as being shy ghosts, a Shade will lower its activity in the presence of multiple players. ==Behaviour== ===Activity=== On average, the Shade is less likely to perform interactions than other ghosts. The Shade is less likely to perform ghost events at high sanity. At 100% average sanity, it has a 0% chance of successfully performing an event. This success rate increases by 2% per percentage of average sanity lost; at an average sanity of 50%, an attempted ghost event will always succeed. When it performs a ghost event, the Shade has a higher chance of appearing as a shadow. If the ghost is made to appear using a Summoning Circle, a Music Box, or a Monkey Paw, it has a 50% chance of appearing as a black shadow rather than in its full form while in the ghost event stage. It will return to a fully visible form when the hunt begins. {| class=\"mw-collapsible mw-collapsed fandom-table\" !colspan=\"2\"|Advanced mechanics |- !colspan=\"2\"|WARNING: This data is based on testing and not officially verified. |- !Ghost event chances |The Shade cannot perform singing events. Instead, it has a 60% chance to perform a mist form event overall. The other event mechanics (stated above) remain true at the same time. |} ===(In)abilities=== If at least one person is in the same room as a Shade, it will be unable to perform interactions (including the fuse box and when players try to force an interaction through the Voodoo Doll), ghost events, or initiate hunts, regardless of average sanity. It may still perform these actions if it happens to wander into a room without players. Since interactions occur in a range, the Shade can still \"reach\" into the player's room from another room to interact with objects. {| class=\"mw-collapsible mw-collapsed fandom-table\" !colspan=\"2\"|Advanced mechanics |- !colspan=\"2\"|WARNING: This data is based on testing and not officially verified. |- !Object throws |When performing an object throw, the Shade cannot use the variant where the object levitates before being thrown towards a player. This also applies during hunts. |- !Interactions during hunts |When the Shade is in the same room as a player during a hunt, though it can interact with doors normally like any other ghost, it is unable to blow out flames. |} ===Hunt=== The Shade can only hunt below an average sanity of 35%, lower than most other ghosts. ==Evidence== ==Strengths and weaknesses== These are the strengths and weaknesses as listed in the journal: Strength: Shades are much harder to find. Weakness: The ghost will not enter a hunt if there are people nearby. ==Strategies== Due to the Shade's aforementioned shyness, the lack of interactions may give it away, or players may become frustrated at the ghost not producing evidence, though this also makes them one of the safer ghosts to encounter, as their shyness also extends to hunts. Try keeping everyone out of the ghost room, as well as using Incense or specific cursed possessions that will increase the chance of the ghost interacting with the environment. Turning off the lights in the ghost's room may also help. Given the Shade's inability to hunt in a room with players, one can be tested for in Nightmare/Insanity difficulty simply by lowering the average sanity close to zero, and having players stand in the ghost's current room and rooms directly adjacent. If it refuses to hunt or hunts only from a room without players, then it may be a Shade; players should identify nearby escape routes and/or prepare Incense before testing this, as the ghost may hunt in the same room as a player if it's actually not a Shade, which can be very dangerous, especially since a Shade shares two evidence types with a Jinn which is extremely difficult to escape from if the fuse box is on, and a Revenant which is almost certain death if it hunts in the same room as a player. In singleplayer on Nightmare or Insanity difficulty, one way to identify a Shade is to drop the average sanity to zero, before using two Sanity Medications to restore the player's sanity to 50%, then allowing a small drop of sanity for a few seconds within the investigation area before stopping it via room lights (ideally hiding far away or on a different floor to prevent witnessing ghost events that may drain sanity). A ghost that refuses to hunt at this sanity may indicate that the ghost is a Shade. If trying to identify a Shade by its hunt sanity threshold, keep in mind a Deogen and aged Thaye will also have low hunting sanity thresholds, though a Deogen is extremely easily distinguishable from its hunting behavior, and a Thaye will initially have a much higher sanity threshold, and be very active in stark contrast to a Shade; a Mare will also have a similarly low sanity threshold when the lights in its ghost room are on; turn it off to raise its sanity threshold and prevent mistaking it for a Shade. The Shade appearing as a shadow when manifested by cursed possessions is not guaranteed, so seeing a full-body manifestation with them does not rule out a Shade. A common misconception surrounds the technicality on Shades performing interactions or ghost events in the same room as the player: *All ghosts have a range in which they can interact. Simply put, the Shade can \"interact through walls\". More precisely, if the Shade is in a room with no players, but its interaction range extends into a room with players, then the Shade can still interact with items inside the room with players provided that they are covered by the interaction range. **In general, this logic also applies for ghosts not being able to throw items in a lit room. *Additionally, a ghost event will always occur in the same room as a player, but the ghost does not have to be in that room to initiate it; for physical events, the ghost will teleport to the chosen player's room once the event is triggered, while no teleportation occurs for mist form events. This remains true for the Shade. See Ghost Event for more information on ghost events. ==Trivia== *Shade (lat. umbra, gr. σκιά) - in the mythology of many peoples, the ghost or spirit of the dead human, who is in the afterlife. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access Alpha |- !24 March 2020 |Added Shade. |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !0.3.0 |Prior to 0.3.0, the evidence was EMF Level 5, Ghost Orb, and Ghost Writing. |- ! rowspan=\"4\" |0.5.0 |Reduced the number of players required in the Shade's current room to prevent hunts from 2 to 1. |- |Being in the same room as the Shade will now prevent EMF 3 interactions. |- |The Shade now prefers shadow form if manifesting during a ghost event. |- |Reduced the Shade's hunt sanity threshold from 50% to 35%. |- !0.5.2.0 |Shades now have a chance to fail ghost events at higher sanities. |- !? |Shades can no longer perform interactions when a player is in its current room. |- !0.10.0 |Shades can no longer blow out fire sources and write in Ghost Writing Books if there are any players in the same room. |} ==References== ru:Тень fr:Ombre Category:Ghosts","title":"Shade","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Shade"}
{"content":"The Parabolic Microphone, sometimes referred to as a \"paramic\", is a piece of equipment in Phasmophobia. It can detect sounds through walls and at a great distance, serving almost as a handheld version of the sound sensor. ==Mechanics== The parabolic microphone allows the player to hear an idle ghost's normally inaudible paranormal sounds (voices, growls, etc.), as well as amplifying any other sounds like object interactions. The parabolic microphone must be inside the building to detect sounds. When activated, the player will distinctively hear the sounds produced in front of the microphone with an angle of 110° horizontally, whether they are made by the ghost, another player, active equipment, or ambient noises, while all other sounds will be significantly muffled. The Tier I and Tier II parabolic microphones will only detect sounds on the same floor as the player. ===Ghost Sound Traits=== *Mylings make paranormal sounds more often than other ghosts. *Banshees have a certain chance of using a unique paranormal sound. *Moroi will curse players who hear their paranormal sounds, resulting in an increased passive sanity drain. ===Tier I=== The Tier I Parabolic Microphone has a range of 20 meters forward. It has a red light that will flicker when it detects sound. ===Tier II=== The Tier II Parabolic Microphone has a range of 30 meters forward and has an additional screen which will display three sets of numbers: * The largest number display (000.0) measures the total sum of sound (in decibels) from all detected sources. * The Min and Peak values display the quietest and loudest individual sound levels picked up, respectively. ** For example, if a 16 dB sound, a 17 dB sound, and a 19 dB sound are picked up, Min will display 16 dB and Peak will display 19 dB, and the sum will be 52 dB. During a hunt, the display will rapidly flash random numbers. ===Tier III=== The Tier III Parabolic Microphone is similar to the Tier II Parabolic Microphone, but it includes a sonar function, allowing its screen to display the position and the volume of each individual sound. It can also detect sounds one floor above or below the user. <!-- ====Sound sources and reading values==== <small>This list is outdated</small> *Ambient sounds not caused by ghost: ≤ 0.5 dB *Ghost's current location: ≤ 1 dB *Keyboard being pressed: 1.0 - 2.0 dB * Light being toggled: 1.0 - 2.0 dB *Fuse box: **0.5 - 0.9 dB (small blue box) **3 dB (small red box/generator, player only) **None (lever, player only) *Door: **4.0 dB (Player closing door) **2.0 - 3.0 dB (Ghost) *Desk radio static: 5.0 dB *Running sink: 5.0 dB *Spirit box static: 5.0 dB *Objects thrown by the ghost or the player (including the parabolic microphone itself): ≥ 1 - 3 dB *Paintings falling *Window knocks *Paranormal sounds: 0.5 - 1.0 dB *Random ghost footsteps (not caused by salt): 1.0 ~ 3.0 dB--> ==Tips == *The player should remain aware of other noises, such as interactions from players. Coordinate with others and communicate to know whether a sound might have originated from a player or the ghost. *Although generally disregarded for smaller maps, it may come in handy on larger ones (such as Brownstone High School and Sunny Meadows Mental Institution) for locating the ghost by pointing players in its general direction; this becomes even more effective in a team, where two players can use a Parabolic Microphone at different locations, and pinpoint the ghost's location quite accurately. *On large maps where a hunt might start without players even knowing, a Parabolic Microphone is a good way to provide advance warning from a far distance that a hunt has started/is in progress, and warn players to stay away from that direction. ==Objectives== {| class=\"article-table\" !

{"content":"Nell's Diner is a small map in Phasmophobia. It is similar in size to 6 Tanglewood Drive and is unlocked at level 5. ==Structure== Nell's Diner is a one-story diner with a spacious dining area, three bathrooms, rooms for the staff, a kitchen, and a cold room. ===Layout tips=== *The fuse box cools the Cooler Room down to at a rate of 0.1°C (0.18°F) per second instead of heating it. *The Cooler Room has a dynamic temperature cap that prevents temperatures from going above a certain value. The cap starts at the weather's ambient temperature or at its lowest value, respectively when the fuse box is off or on at start. If off at start, turning the fuse box on will progressively lower the cap at a rate of 0.1°C (0.18°F) per second to a lowest of: ** for Sunrise ** for Clear, Fog, and Blood Moon ** for Windy, Light Rain, and Heavy Rain ** for Snow *The Foyer cannot be chosen as a favourite room. *The Foyer doesn't have any light to prevent passive sanity drain. See Third-party tools for a list of detailed map viewers that players may use. ===Key hiding spots and strategies=== There are 4 \"sanctioned\" hiding spots in Nell's Diner: *Storage, behind food cart *Cooler Room, behind food cart *Hallway, behind blue vending machine *Break Room, lockers Depending on the difficulty, some of these hiding spots may be blocked by the presence of bulky items or their concealing elements removed: *Amateur: None *Intermediate: None *Professional: 1 *Nightmare/Insanity: 2 *3-player game: +1 available hiding spot *4-player game: +2 available hiding spots <small>Additional hiding spots on multiplayer is overridden when \"Number of hiding places\" is set to None</small> Looping the ghost may be performed around the kitchen island, the dining area, or the counter. ==Bone locations== Bones spawn randomly, but will only spawn in areas that a ghost can also walk on. ;Examples ==Cursed possession locations== <gallery> NellsDiner-Circle.png|The Summoning Circle spawns in the Men's Bathroom.

The easter egg is triggered by completing the following steps on any difficulty: #Shine a UV light on the reminder post-it note in the Manager's Office. This will give you three arrows: Down, Up, Right. #Find the code outside, in three locations, each corresponding to an arrow (4 is in the Dining Area on the wall to the left upon first entry. It is being pointed to by the road sign angling down. 1 is underneath the neon sign by the road, pointed to by an upwards arrow. 5 can be found in the dumpster area, pointed to by a graffiti arrow pointing right). #Open the safe in the Manager's Office, under the desk, with the code. #Take the debit card inside to the ATM in Hallway and it in the card slot. #Pick up the dollar bill and buy a soda from the red Mr. Sprinkle vending machine to the left of the ATM by placing it in the insert slot. #Pick up the coin that drops from the machine upon buying a drink. #Place the coin in the Lair of the Unliving arcade machine, located in the Break Room. Only one player in a game has to complete this as everyone in the lobby will receive the reward, regardless of who actually completed it. ==Trivia== *Lore-wise, Nell's Diner is located in Tucson, Arizona. *There are tumbleweeds that roll along the road outside the diner periodically every 50 seconds. *The Nell's Diner sign flickers the word \"Die\". *There is a movie poster titled Demon Dog, which is in reference to a pre-release concept of the game. **The feature consisted of a demon dog chasing you after death, which if you succeeded in out-running resulted in the player being revived. *There are several ghost name references hidden throughout the map. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !0.15.0 |Added Nell's Diner. |- !0.15.1.0 |Nell's Diner now unlocks for players at Level 5. |}<br> Category:Maps Category:Small Map fr:Nell's Diner","title":"Nell's Diner","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Nell's_Diner"}
{"content":"The player is the main character being controlled in Phasmophobia. ==Carrying items== Non-VR players can carry up to 4 pieces of equipment, including one special slot for igniters. VR players have a toolbelt which carries a walkie-talkie and the journal by default. In total, VR players can carry up to 5 pieces of equipment, including one in each hand and two more on the toolbelt (excluding the walkie-talkie and journal), as well as a special slot for an igniter. VR players cannot open doors while holding items in both hands. ==Movement== By default, the player at 1.6 m/s, and can at 3 m/s for a maximum of 3 seconds. The sprint stamina regenerates at the same frequency as its depletion 2 seconds after the player stops sprinting. If the sprint stamina is completely depleted, the player must wait 5 seconds before being able to sprint again. Sprinting and player speed can be customised via custom difficulty settings. VR players also have the option of a \"teleport circle\" (point-and-trigger) which allows for moving a short distance at a time. ==Death== A player dies presumably if their collision box collides with the ghost (or a \"kill area\"), while there is line-of-sight. Once dead, they can only pick up items that are not considered equipment, and will see the world covered in a grey fog. Dead players can sprint infinitely. ==Player model== On the player, there are six points, three on the head and three on the legs, that are used to determine whether the ghost has line-of-sight with the player during a hunt. These are anchored to the player's point-of-view, and not the actual model that is visible. If the ghost can see either all three points on the head or all three points on the legs, the ghost is considered to have line-of-sight with the player. There are currently eight player models that are available; players can switch between any of them while in a lobby by clicking the character portrait on their own ID Card.

{"content":"The music box is a cursed possession that can be used to pinpoint the location of the ghost, though one is at considerable risk if one is careless with it. ==Mechanics== A music box has a 1 in 7 chance per contract of being chosen as the cursed possession that will spawn, with one specific spawn location per map. ===Activation and usage=== When picked up, the music box will open (this does not mean it has been activated). The music box can then be activated using the key. Doing so will end the setup phase early if it is ongoing. The music box cannot be activated during a hunt, and can only be used once. Once activated, if the ghost is within 20 metres of the music box, it will sing along, broadcasting its current location while remaining invisible. If the music box is within 5 metres of the ghost, it will trigger a ghost event where the ghost manifests and begins to walk towards the box. The music box can be handheld or on the floor, the latter being the only safe way to discard the box without triggering a cursed hunt before the ghost event. In all cases, the box will close once it stops playing. ===Cursed hunt=== While using the music box, a cursed hunt will be initiated if one of the following occurs: *The ghost is within a short distance of the player holding the box *The ghost walks during the box-triggered ghost event for more than 5 seconds *The box is thrown while the tune is playing *The player reaches or is already at 0% sanity By avoiding all of the above, it is possible to use the music box without causing any hunt: *Ensuring that no one is inside the investigation area when the above occurs (future hunts will be extended if the breaking method would have caused a cursed hunt) *When the music ends without the ghost ever being near enough, the music box will automatically close *If the player brings the music box near the ghost only just before the music stops playing, the ghost will simply disappear when the music ends. Note that while the music box is playing, the ghost can still initiate a hunt on its own due to meeting normal hunt conditions rather than the box itself; this results in a standard hunt instead of a cursed hunt. ===Other effects=== Being within 3 metres of an actively functioning music box drains the player's sanity at a rate of 2.6%/s, totalling 77% if the entire song is listened to. This applies to all players within the range, regardless of who activated the music box. As long as the box-triggered ghost event has not occurred, an active music box will not prevent regular ghost activity, which means that the ghost can continue to roam, interact with objects, use its abilities, or even perform regular ghost events and hunts. While the ghost will not actively walk towards the music box if it is out of range, it can happen to roam close enough to trigger the ghost event. If the music box is brought outside, the box will close. If the music is also playing, the sanity drain will pause, but the music will technically continue. It will reopen and function normally once the music box is brought inside again. ===Ghosts=== *The Shade has a chance of appearing as a black shadow rather than in its full form while walking towards the box. *Compared to other ghosts, the Yokai must be closer to the player holding the box (within 2.5 metres) to trigger the ghost event. ===Rewards=== Taking a photo of a music box, used or not, will yield a photo labelled as Music Box. Recording the sound of the box while it is active will yield a sound labelled as Music Box. Each of these pieces of media can reward up to $7 and 7 XP, depending on the equipment tier and whether there is a Unique stamp. ==Strategies and tips== The music box can be broken down into two primary uses: 1) utilize the triggered ghost event and following hunt to complete relevant objectives and/or to identify the ghost type, or 2) get the ghost to broadcast its current position to narrow down and locate its favourite room. The music box is an easy way to obtain a ghost photo/video, but beware that switching to another item while holding the music box will automatically throw it and immediately cause a hunt; it should be placed down before switching. In multiplayer games, one way is to have the player who records media carry the smudge stick while another player activates the music box. The player holding the music box should refill their sanity to a comfortable level to avoid a 0% sanity-triggered hunt. If the player wants to trigger a hunt, it is advised to do so by throwing the box while at a safe location rather than walking to the ghost to trigger the event and subsequent hunt, as the latter method puts the player in close proximity to the ghost when it begins hunting which is quite dangerous and can lead to death especially against ghosts such as a Revenant. On smaller maps such as the suburban houses, it can be quite difficult to avoid getting too close and triggering the event and subsequent cursed hunt especially if the player is not sure where the ghost is, so caution should be advised when using it, and the player should also take some precautions in case this happens: *Carrying along a tier III Crucifix can come in handy to prevent the cursed hunt entirely; if the ghost event is triggered, quickly place down the box and swap to the Crucifix, which will block the hunt when the event ends. *Bringing Incense, tier III Salt and tier III Sanity Medication can all help with escaping the ghost as with all hunts. *If the event does trigger, immediately place down the box and run away from the ghost to put some distance between the player and the ghost before the cursed hunt begins. Players should be especially careful when using a Music Box if the ghost is a Wraith, as it can teleport to the player holding the box, and instantly start a cursed hunt at their location, leading to an almost-guaranteed death. ==Gallery== <gallery> File:Music Box.png|Music box in the lobby showcase File:Musicbox woodwind.jpg|Music box in Camp Woodwind File:Musicbox ridgeview girlsbedroom.png|Music box in 10 Ridgeview Court File:Musicbox edgefield livingroom.png|Music box in 42 Edgefield Road File:Bleasdale-Music Box.jpg|Music box in Bleasdale Farmhouse File:Willow-MusicBox.jpg|Music box in 13 Willow Street </gallery> ==Trivia== *When players interact with a piano's keyboard, it will play 1-2 notes from the Music Box's song, with the whole song playing when repeatedly interacting with the piano. *The tune of the music box was composed by Lavender, one of the game's developers, and is titled \"Adrift\". **The name and sheet music for the song can be seen inside the Music Box's top lid and above Bleasdale Farmhouse's piano. **A full piano version is available on Spotify. *The Music Box is available as official merchandise on The Music Box Store. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !0.5.0 |Added the music box. |} ==Notes== Category:Item fr:Boîte à musique ru:Музыкальная шкатулка","title":"Music Box","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Music_Box"}
{"content":"The Monkey Paw is a cursed possession that can be used to grant the player wishes. ==Mechanics== A Monkey Paw has a 1 in 7 chance per contract of being chosen as the cursed possession that will spawn on a default difficulty (except Insanity), with one specific spawn location per map. The Monkey Paw grants up to a certain number of wishes depending on the difficulty reward multiplier: *0x – 1x: 5 wishes *1.01x – 2x: 4 wishes *2.01x or higher: 3 wishes The Monkey Paw can only be used within the investigation area, and players can choose to either use voice chat or a text-based UI to make wishes. *If using voice chat, the Monkey Paw will grant any recognized wish made by the player. *If using the text-based UI, the UI will appear upon pressing the button. Players can then click to select one of 3 categories, then select a category-specific wish, or exit the UI by pressing the button again. Every wish will come with a negative side effect, with the severity depending on the wish. If the Monkey Paw recognizes a valid phrase, regardless if it is a valid wish or not, or when entering/exiting the investigation area, its fingers will twitch. When a wish is being granted, one of its fingers will bend. When all fingers are bent, the Monkey Paw cannot be used anymore. Most wishes can be found on tags scattered in Sunny Meadows, these tags look the same as the one found on a Monkey Paw. Picking a tag up (except for \"I wish for [weather]\" and \"I wish for anything\" tags, as well as the Monkey Paw's own tag) will record the wish in the journal. There is no need to find the wishes to use the Monkey Paw. Each wish can only be used once per contract, regardless of the wisher. ===Wishes=== {| class=\"fandom-table\" !Category !Wish !Effects !Sunny Meadows wish tag location |- ! rowspan=\"3\" |Ghost | *I wish to see the ghost |Triggers a summoning ghost event at the ghost's current location, locking all exit doors immediately.

During this period, the ghost cannot hunt, roam, or use abilities. This will also lock all doors connected to the wisher's current room for 1 minute. After this period, all doors will unlock and the ghost will start a standard hunt. There is a 25% chance for doors to unlock only after the grace period. |Female Dorm Room |- ! rowspan=\"3\" |Player | *I wish for sanity *I wish to be sane |Sets every player to 50% sanity.

The ghost then teleports near the wisher and initiates a cursed hunt.

Examples include \"I wish for infinite wishes\" which may be misheard as \"I wish for sun\". Sometimes the wishes \"I wish to be sane\" and \"I wish to be safe\" can be misheard as the other wish. ===Rewards=== Taking a photo of a Monkey Paw, regardless of the number of uses, will yield a photo labelled as Monkey Paw, and reward up to $7 and 7 XP, depending on the tier of the Photo Camera. ==Tips== *The Monkey Paw is one of the most versatile cursed possessions in the game, and can assist players in the completion of most objectives. The various wishes can be called upon on command at any time, meaning that players can control when and where to employ their effects to maximize the benefits and minimize the downsides. **In multiplayer, the Monkey Paw becomes even more powerful than it already is in singleplayer, as a lot of wish downsides only affect the wisher. *One of the safety wish's downsides, allowing the ghost to detect the wisher from any distance, while significant on paper, can actually be used to the wisher's benefit to bait the ghost to wherever the wisher is, whether to save a teammate, or to lead it to a favourable looping spot for hunt identification and/or photos. *The knowledge wish becomes slightly more useful in reduced-evidence difficulties, as this wish always eliminates an incorrect evidence type and never a hidden evidence type, making it the only method to guarantee that an evidence type is incorrect. Its harsh downsides, however, make this wish a last resort and should only ever be used near the end of a contract. *The weather wish can be used if the current weather (such as Blood Moon) is not desired, or to change the ambient temperature to aid in getting Freezing Temperatures or slowing a Hantu down, which is especially useful if the fuse box is broken or the map is an outdoors map. *If not using the text UI, the Monkey Paw is always active when held. Be careful when speaking while holding it as you may accidentally call upon a wish. **This is especially notable when using push-to-talk, as there are bugs that make the Monkey Paw listen to the player even if no voice chat button is being pressed. *The vision loss from certain wishes is very significant, making it near impossible for a player afflicted by it to see more than a meter or so in front of them. While this can be partially circumvented by setting game brightness to a very high value, the affected player will be more or less rendered helpless and will need to be guarded accordingly. Thus, it is recommended for the wisher to use these wishes while in a hiding spot. ==Trivia== *The Monkey Paw was available as official merchandise for a limited time, until 3 July 2024 (UK time). *When wishing for sanity, the ghost doesn't teleport immediately to the new ghost room, but will have to enter the \"Favourite room\" state to walk to its new room, which usually happens shortly after wishing. Tier III salt can be used to deter this. *The idea of a \"Monkey's Paw\" being used to grant wishes is very likely inspired by the short story The Monkey's Paw by W. W. Jacobs. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !0.8.1.0 |Added Monkey Paw. |- !0.9.0 |“I wish to see the ghost” will no longer teleport the ghost in front of you, instead it will reveal it where the ghost is, in its current position. |- !0.10.0 |\"I wish to see the ghost\" will now limit the user's vision after the ghost event instead of before. |- !? |Lowered the number of wishes for difficulties between 1x and 3x. |} ==Notes== Category:Item fr:Patte de singe ru:Обезьянья лапа","title":"Monkey Paw","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Monkey_Paw"}

{"content":"The motion sensor is a piece of equipment that can help in tracking the movement of the ghost. ==Usage== A motion sensor can used by it. After being placed, it can be turned off by with it. ===Tier I=== The Tier I Motion Sensor can either be placed on the wall or on the floor. When placed, the sensor will emit a red laser beam, indicating its effective detection distance. If it is placed on a wall, it will also display on the Site Map in the truck as a red bar. When a player (even if they are dead and spectating), the ghost, the mist form, or an object passes through its laser beam, the motion sensor will emit a bright light for 2 seconds. The bar on the site map will also turn green for 6 seconds, and an audible beep will play from the monitor. Motion sensors that are not displayed will still play the beep. ===Tier II=== The Tier II Motion Sensor is similar to the Tier I Motion Sensor and adds a conical mode which can be switched to by with it. The conical mode allows the sensor to have a second laser beam that can help players track the ghost's movement more accurately, as its lights will be emitted from left to right, or from right to left, depending on the direction of the movement. Additionally, the Tier II Motion Sensor will directly emit an audible beep when it detects movement. ===Tier III=== The Tier III Motion Sensor can only be placed on the floor and has a 1.5-metre spherical range that is displayed as a red circle on the site map in the truck. When the ghost enters this range, the sensor will quickly rotate to the location it detected the ghost, and will emit a small light and an audible beep. On the site map, the red circle will turn green for 6 seconds. When the ghost exits the range, the sensor will only rotate to the location it detected the ghost and emit a light, without beeping. Only the ghost can trigger this sensor. ===Rewards=== Filming a motion sensor being triggered by the ghost will yield a Motion Sensed video, rewarding up to $7 and 7 XP, depending on the tier of the Video Camera and whether there is a Unique stamp. ==Tips== *Placing motion sensors at corners or room boundaries can help to track where the ghost is. ==Gallery== <gallery> File:Motion sensor t3 tanglewood.jpg|Tier III motion sensor's range shown on map as a red circle.

{"content":"Since the beginning of development, some features have been removed from the game, having been replaced or deemed unsuitable for the game at its current state. Most of these features were removed before Early Access release on Steam. ==Ghosts== ;General ]] *For around a week after the game's early access Steam release, one type of ghost event was to mimic player models who were either alive but outside the building or dead, and walk towards a particular player before vanishing. Phantoms performing this event would also show putrefied skin on the player model. This type of ghost event was likely removed in version 0.165 initially to fix a bug, but has never been re-implemented for unknown reasons. *For some time, ghosts could stare at the targeted player during a ghost event. ;Jinn *Jinns were able to affect the weather. This was replaced by a chasing speed that depended on whether the player was running, which itself was later replaced with its current ability of having a higher speed if its target is further away. ;Mare *Mares had the ability to cause hallucinations, which would drop a player's sanity, and could be stopped by toggling one's flashlight. This was replaced with the current light-based hunt sanity threshold. **The old journal description of this ability was once accidentally added in 0.3.1.0, and reverted in a same-version hotfix. ==Evidence== *Bile: replaced with Ghost Particles, which are now known as Ghost Orbs. *Blood: replaced with EMF Level 5. *Bug (insects): replaced with various other evidences. **In the Phasmophobia Official Announcement Trailer, a cockroach can be seen in the living room. *Dirty Water: replaced with Ghost Writing, but still exists as a photo reward. *Ectoplasm: replaced with Spirit Box. *Handprints: originally found on walls, instead of certain objects that the ghost interacted with. Replaced with Fingerprints. *Wall Scratches *Fingerprints: Replaced with Ultraviolet. Fingerprints only included finger or handprints left by the ghost when interacting with applicable surfaces or items, such as doors, keyboards, and light switches (though these evidences still count as Ultraviolet). Footprints were not an evidence but a photo reward, and every ghost except the Wraith could create them. **Prior to 0.9.0, Fingerprints and Footprints did not need to be illuminated with a UV light to be photographed; this meant that fingerprints could be found without a UV light by photographing the touched surface and look if the photo was labelled as \"Fingerprints\". *Prior to 0.9.0, D.O.T.S silhouettes used to be a duplicate of the ghost that would be generated when the real ghost interacted with the D.O.T.S Projector. This meant that a D.O.T.S silhouette could appear while the real ghost was already manifesting, such as during a hunt or a ghost event. D.O.T.S silhouettes are now the real ghost becoming temporarily visible under the light of a Projector. *Prior to the introduction of sound and video recording in 0.13.0, bonus evidence could only be collected as photos. Ephemeral events (such as doors moving or objects being thrown) could be recorded by taking a photo of the affected object while the EMF signature was still active. The value of a photo was determined using a 3-star rating system. The number of stars was determined according to the distance from the subject, and how close it was to the center of the frame. Furthermore, certain subjects could only be photographed once for a reward (such as the Ghost or Cursed Posessions); duplicate photos were worthless and could waste precious space in the Journal. Subjects that could be photographed multiple time (such as ultraviolet evidence or disturbed salt piles) provided normal rewards every new instance. **The rating and subject priority system (which determined what subject to record if multiple were detected within the frame) was notoriously finicky and prone to bugs, as it could potentially ruin high-value shots (one peculiarly common instance were piles of salt incorrectly taking priority over the ghost). Because of this, the rating system was simplified so that the value of a photo is determined by whether or not it is unique or a duplicate, the latter providing a reduced reward (including previous multi-instance subjects like salt piles). ==Hunts== *A ghost was able to teleport if it could not find a target during hunts. Currently, there is no ghost that can teleport during a hunt, though the Wraith can teleport randomly to a player outside of hunts, and certain phases (e.g. manifestation ghost event, end of a hunt) require the ghost to teleport. *Prior to 0.26.8.1, ghosts completely lacked object permanence, which meant that it would forget its target as soon as it left its field of vision and resume wandering immediately. They also did not accelerate with line of sight until 0.28.6.5, allowing players to outrun most chasing ghosts so long they remained in constant motion. With hunts being fairly easy to survive, the developers decided to make gameplay more engaging by making the ghost's AI able to follow players around corners and accelerate when they saw a player to prevent them from simply outpacing the ghost. **Additionally, furniture could not break line of sight; only doors or walls could block the ghost's vision. This was also changed in line with the new hunting behaviors. *Prior to 0.3.0, hunts would cause map lights, flashlights and the global chat to malfunction everywhere on the map, including outside. Because using electronics at the time also did not attract the ghost, it was very easy to check for the beginning or the end of a hunt simply by observing the flashlight beam or by occasionally pressing the global chat key to check for static. To make hunts less predictable, electronics and the global chat now only malfunction when the ghost is near enough, and will also attract the ghost if toggled nearby. *Up until 0.5.0, when the ghost hunted, it could randomly appear either in its fully physical form, its shadowy form, or its translucent, jelly-like form. It was changed to only use its physical form to make tracking the ghost much more consistent during a hunt, as its other forms often made it unnecessarily difficult to see, especially in scenarios where overlapping light maps would make it essentially disappear. ==Gameplay== *On some maps, garage and basement doors required keys that could be found within the map. The ghost could also occasionally lock these doors. The door locking feature was removed before the game's initial release on Steam, while these keys were removed later on. Only three keys currently exist: one for unlocking the (main) entrance door, one for turning off the car alarm on certain maps, and one for the cabin in Maple Lodge Campsite (the ghost cannot lock this door). *Until 0.4.0, a random assortment of three to five maps would be given to the host of the lobby to select from for the next mission. If the maps given by the system were undesirable, either one of the maps would have to be loaded then immediately left; or in multiplayer the host would have to leave the lobby, thereby promoting another player in the lobby as host to see which range of maps they were given. **For a short time after release, the difficulty of these contracts were also random, further necessitating such measures to try and play the desired maps and/or difficulties. *Until 0.3.0.4, it was possible to interact with equipment that was held by other players. This was removed to prevent trolling during hunts as electronic equipment held by players now attracted the ghost. *Footsteps from an idling ghost could be periodically heard without the aid of any equipment, which could be reliably used to narrow down its location. Since 0.3.0, ghost footsteps can only be heard when using a Parabolic Microphone or when the ghost has walked through Salt. *Players used to have to search for the ghost's name around the map instead of being already provided with it. This feature was removed early on in development as it was deemed too difficult on larger maps. The toggleable computer monitor found on 6 Tanglewood Drive displaying \"Thomas Wilson\", as well as the name \"Nancy\" above the crib in the Nursery, are remnants of this feature. *Players with low sanity would start to hear auditory hallucinations that would increase in frequency as their sanity decayed. This was removed shortly before the early access release of the game. *Prior to 0.9.0, seeing freezing breath was a conclusive indicator of Freezing Temperatures without having to use a Thermometer. *Prior to 0.9.0, training took place at 6 Tanglewood Drive as a modified Amateur contract with no secondary objectives or rewards. A ghost was haunting the location, its type was randomly selected, it provided evidence as normal, but it could not hunt. A short slideshow displayed on the TV in the living room detailed each evidence and how to spot them. *Prior to 0.9.0.9 the passive sanity drain was determined by calculating the level of ambient light around the player's head (whether it be from on-site lights or firelights). This complex system was notably resource-intensive, and was also in practice peculiarly finicky. Due to this, it was replaced by the current system, where the passive sanity drain depends on whether all main light sources in a room are on or off, regardless of the player's physical position in relation to light sources within the room. *Decorative candles found on certain maps could be grabbed and could mitigate passive sanity drain just like purchased candles. This is no longer the case as of 0.9.0; they can no longer be grabbed or moved and do not affect sanity drain. They can still be lit to provide a non-electric light source however. *Until 0.10.0.1, Phasmophobia had support for BHaptics haptic feedback apparel to provide simulated physical sensations, chiefly for VR players. Support was removed due to very low usage and it causing performance issues among VR players. ==Equipment== *Infrared Light Sensors emitted light when a player or ghost walked past. It did not complete any motion sensor-related challenges when triggered by the ghost. This feature was merged into the current Motion Sensor. *Strong Flashlights were a separate item, with their own store tab and spot in the truck, that acted as a direct upgrade to the regular Flashlight, bearing a brighter, more powerful light. Its model and overall functionality would be reused for the Tier II Flashlight. **Similarly, Glowsticks were a separate item from UV Lights, even though they had the same purpose. It became the Tier I, and then later the Tier II UV Light. ==Maps== *6 Tanglewood Drive used to have skeletons scattered around the house which could only be seen by dead players. This was removed shortly after the Steam Early Access release of the game. *Prior to 0.4.0, 6 Tanglewood Drive had permanent rainy weather. This at the time was purely cosmetic and did not influence the investigation other than producing a mild noise disturbance. **The thunder sound effect that was initially used on Tanglewood became notable for unintentionally featuring a faint scream at the end. It was replaced with a new, clean sound effect in v.0.26.6. *Asylum was the first large map added to the game. This map was notable for both its immense size, with over 200 distinct rooms, as well as its confusing maze-like layout, earning a reputation of being a notoriously difficult and frustrating map even for the most seasoned of players. This map was replaced with the smaller and much more intuitive Sunny Meadows Mental Institution. *Before the introduction of Cursed Possessions, the Ouija Board was a special standalone item which had a 50% chance per contract of spawning at one of several set locations on a given map. Moreover, questions asked to the Ouija Board had a chance to fail and would induce a severe sanity loss. It would go through several changes before becoming part of the Cursed Possessions collection. *The original versions of both Farmhouses (Grafton and Bleasdale), as well as 13 Willow Street, had a few decorative voodoo doll props scattered around the location, which could be photographed for a photo reward. These voodoo dolls had no additional functionality nor effect on the ghost, though there were many rumours abound that throwing them could force the ghost to perform an interaction or that they would always point towards the ghost room when they landed on the ground. These voodoo doll props were removed with the introduction of the Voodoo Doll and the other Cursed Possessions in 0.5.0, although their old spawn locations were reused for the cursed possessions' spawn locations. *Maple Lodge Campsite was originally released with an entirely different layout. The initial iteration was significantly more open, featuring very large outdoor spaces and scant hiding spots. The vast open spaces notably caused performance issues with line-of-sight calculation, and made it difficult for players to escape a chasing ghost. The map was almost entirely changed with the 0.9.1.0 update for optimization and balance; the only unchanged sections of the original map are the Cabin and the Pier. *The game was initially released with largely different versions of the Farmhouse maps (Bleasdale and Grafton). Being added in the relatively early stages of development, both houses were created entierly using the Vintage House pre-made asset pack, and thus were largely similar in appearance and ambience. They were eventually replaced by much more detailed and unique versions, each featuring its own theme and dedicated assets. Bleasdale was replaced by the current version in the 0.12.0.1 update, while Grafton was replaced in the 0.14.0 version. ==References== Category:Development fr:Fonctionnalités retirées","title":"Removed Features","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Removed_Features"}
{"content":"The Raiju is a type of ghost in Phasmophobia. The Raiju siphons the power from electronic equipment to both increase its aggression and boost its speed during a hunt. ==Behaviour== ===Activity=== When a Raiju manifests during a ghost event or a hunt, it will interfere with electronics that are up to 15 metres away on the same floor, instead of the usual 10 metres. This also applies to global chat. ===Hunt=== When the Raiju is within a certain distance of at least one piece of active electronic equipment on the same floor (that can also be located outside the investigation area), its hunt sanity threshold is increased to 65%, and it will move at a fixed speed of 2.5 m/s during hunts: *Small map: 6m *Medium map: 8m *Large map: 10m Otherwise, it will have the standard threshold of 50% and will follow standard ghost speeds with one particularity: if the Raiju has line-of-sight with a player while near active electronic equipment, the speed increase from continuous line-of-sight adds in the background, and will only be applied once it is no longer near any electronics. All effects listed above apply to most electronic equipment, whether they are placed, held in the hand, or dropped on the floor. The following do not count towards the speed boost or the hunt sanity threshold: *Global chat *Video cameras and Photo Cameras that are thrown on the ground *Motion sensors, sound sensors, and D.O.T.S. Projectors that are thrown on the ground or held (excluding T1 D.O.T.S., which also needs to be turned off) *Objects in the inventory (except flashlights that are turned on) *Any other electrical equipment not brought in from the truck (building lights, fuse box, CCTV, fans, etc.) ===Miscellaneous=== The player's heartbeats can be heard within 15 metres of the Raiju, instead of within 10 metres like with other ghosts, making the heartbeats much louder with the Raiju compared to other ghosts. This is likely a bug. ==Strengths and weaknesses== These are the strengths and weaknesses as listed in the journal: Strength: A Raiju can siphon power from nearby electrical devices, making it move faster. Weakness: Raiju are constantly disrupting electronic equipment when attacking, making it easier to track. ==Evidence== ==Strategies== In order to mitigate the risk of an early hunt, it is best to turn off and/or remove any unneeded electronic equipment from the ghost room; this also prevents the Raiju from harnessing this equipment to empower itself while hunting. Lazily discarding such equipment is a surefire way to make a Raiju extremely dangerous. Additionally, players often have the reflex of discarding electronic items behind them when a hunt starts to not attract the ghost's attention to them; this should be avoided with Raijus to not leave a trail of electronic equipment to power its speed ability. Instead, players should either switch to a non-electronic item or turn off their electronic item. The Raiju may be readily-identified by being mindful of its speed during a hunt, particularly on small maps, so long as there are active electronic items nearby. If the ghost suddenly and significantly speeds up when roaming (and not chasing particular players), then it is most likely a Raiju, though be mindful of mistaking this with a Hantu speeding up as it moves from a warm room to a cold room; the only evidence they share is Ghost Orbs so getting any other evidence can confirm whether the ghost is a Raiju or Hantu. A safe way to check for this is to turn off all other nearby active electronics, drop an active electronic in the player's hiding spot, and during a hunt, check if the ghost's footsteps suddenly speed up when nearby. ==Trivia== *In Japanese mythology, Raijus (雷獣, or \"thunder beasts\") are divine creatures most commonly depicted as a canine animal surrounded by lightning. Raijus are thought to be living in the sky, descending onto earth during thunderstorms by riding a lightning bolt to cause mayhem and destruction. As such, lightning strikes were often interpreted as the passage of a Raiju or divine punishment in ancient Japan. In-game, Raijus do not actually appear in animal forms, and simply draws from the regular pool of Ghost Models. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !0.4.0 |Added Raiju.<!-- |- !0.12.0.1 |Increased the heartbeat sound range from 10 to 15 metres.--> |} ==Notes== ru:Райдзю fr:Raiju Category:Ghosts","title":"Raiju","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Raiju"}

{"content":"The setup phase is the starting phase of a game. During this phase, players can explore the location, collect and set up equipments, and locate the ghost before it can initiate a hunt. == Mechanics == The duration of the setup phase depends on the difficulty: {|class=\"article-table\" |+ !Difficulty !Time |- |Amateur |5 minutes |- |Intermediate |2 minutes |- |Professional |rowspan=\"3\"|None |- |Nightmare |- |Insanity |} Countdown of the setup phase is shown on the timer in the truck above the computer, and will only begin when any entryway to the building is opened. During the setup phase, sanity decay due to being in darkness is reduced by roughly 30%, and sanity cannot go below 50%. Additionally, the ghost cannot initiate a hunt on its own, regardless of its hunt sanity threshold or any abilities it may have. Other than these conditions, the setup phase does not affect the ghost's behaviour or other game mechanics. When the time runs out, the ghost will be allowed to initiate a hunt, depending on the ghost type and the players' average sanity, and the sanity drain rate will increase to normal. The setup phase can be ended early by activating or using any cursed possession. There is currently a bug where the Ouija Board cancels the setup phase only if it recognizes a valid phrase instead of upon activation. == Tips == *The setup time is valuable for newer players in setting up equipment, looking for evidence, and scouting hiding spots before the ghost is permitted to hunt. *Having the setup phase end does not mean that the ghost will immediately begin hunting, as whether ghosts can hunt is generally dependent on whether the average team sanity is below a certain threshold.

{"content":"The Mimic is a type of ghost in Phasmophobia. They are known for mimicking the traits of other ghosts. ==Behaviour== ===Ability=== The Mimic is able to imitate any type of ghost, and inherit all of its features and abilities: *Interaction and ghost event rates and preferences *Hunt thresholds *Hunt movement speeds *Various forms of special abilities (e.g. Poltergeist multi-throw, Demon ability hunt) When imitating a type of ghost, The Mimic will not copy its types of evidence, and will not necessarily provide its guaranteed type of evidence on reduced-evidence difficulties such as Insanity, but can copy features related to evidence. For example, it is able to copy the Obake's six-fingered handprints or the Deogen's breathing, as The Mimic has Ultraviolet and Spirit Box as evidence, but it cannot copy the Goryo's trait of only appearing on a Video Camera when interacting with a D.O.T.S Projector, as The Mimic does not have D.O.T.S Projector as one of its types of evidence. The Mimic will always start in the \"blank\" state (in which it essentially mimics itself) at the beginning of a contract. When this is the case, it will act as a default ghost and have no special abilities. It will attempt to change 1 minute after an exit door has been opened for the first time, then every 30 seconds to 2 minutes, but cannot change during hunts and ghost events. Additionally, The Mimic cannot imitate the Banshee or the Dayan if it is male. If The Mimic is affected by Incense, it will not be able to hunt for the duration associated with the ghost it was imitating at that moment, even if it imitates another ghost before its end. The Mimic, when imitating some specific ghost types, will have some specific behaviours, listed below: *If The Mimic imitates a Thaye, a fixed age between 0 and 10 is randomly selected, and it will imitate another ghost using its own timer instead of the Thaye's ageing timer. *If The Mimic imitates a Moroi, and curses the player through the Spirit Box, the Parabolic Microphone, or the Sound Recorder, the curse will remain even if The Mimic switches to another ghost type. *If The Mimic imitates a Banshee, initially, it has no target. Once the first non-cursed hunt is attempted, a target is chosen randomly. The Mimic provides \"evidence\" of Ghost Orbs in addition to its three main evidence types, which also appear on difficulties with reduced evidence, including zero evidence. These Ghost Orbs, along with the other types of evidence if none are hidden due to the difficulty, will always exist regardless of the type of ghost that The Mimic chooses to imitate, and will behave in exactly the same way as those produced by other ghost types and will only levitate in the ghost room. ==Evidence== Though Ghost Orbs are always present, this is not considered by the Journal when inputting evidence. Whether Ghost Orbs is selected does not affect your payout even if the ghost is blanked out when selecting the ghost. ==Strengths and weaknesses== These are the strengths and weaknesses as listed in the journal: Strength: We're unsure what this ghost is capable of. Be careful. Weakness: Several reports have noted ghost orb sightings near mimics. ==Strategies== The Mimic's fundamental nature means that it is extremely unpredictable; it might mimic a Shade and be scared to hunt the whole contract, or it could mimic a Moroi and rapidly drain everyone's sanity then turn into a Revenant and wreak havoc with a surprise early hunt. It can theoretically have the powers of almost any ghost type at any time, most notably ghost abilities that could enable early hunts. In theory, the absolute safest way to handle a Mimic is to treat it as if it had every potential modifier that could increase its aggression/drain player sanity faster than usual, and utilize all tactics that would be used to dissuade attacks from other ghost types: *Aggression-related: **Try to minimize speaking when near the ghost (Yokai) **Turn off electronics that are no longer needed (Raiju) **Make sure to have active sources of flame in the Ghost Room (Onryo) **In general, be prepared for the possibility of early hunts (Demon/Thaye) *Sanity-related: **Avoid colliding with the ghost during an event (Oni) **Turn the breaker off (Jinn) **Avoid being in pseudo line-of-sight of the ghost (when the player hears their own heartbeat) (Phantom) **Remove items from the ghost room (Poltergeist) **Close doors in the ghost room (Yurei) In practice, however, it is oftentimes overkill and a great annoyance to perform all of these at once, with some even conflicting with each other, and most of the time it's simpler to just bring in Crucifixes early to stop any surprise hunts and/or take Sanity Medication to refill sanity as needed. Additionally, it is prudent to have Incense handy, as The Mimic may imitate fast ghosts such as the Revenant or Thaye, catch players by surprise by starting a hunt from an unexpected location if it imitates The Twins or a stalking ghost (Wraith, Phantom and Banshee), or most dangerously imitate the Deogen and require players to completely change up their strategy from hiding to looping between hunts, potentially after everyone is already situated at a hiding spot. As The Mimic always produces Ghost Orbs and appears to go over the difficulty's maximum amount of given types of evidence, players have to take care when trying to identify the ghost through evidence. However, this can also cause The Mimic to be very simple to identify, as players only need to confirm an additional type of evidence compared to the difficulty. On difficulties with all three types of evidence, identifying Ultraviolet, Spirit Box and Ghost Orbs also definitively indicates a Mimic, as no other ghost has this evidence combination. Ghost behaviour is also a relatively easy, if somewhat luck-dependent way to identify The Mimic; if the player spots conflicting ghost behaviour throughout the contract that seems to indicate different ghosts at different times, it is most likely The Mimic changing between different ghost types. Similarly, identifying the behaviour of a specific ghost type, but then getting types of evidence that it does not have, gives The Mimic away. For example, if the player hears a Banshee's scream on the Parabolic Microphone, but also gets a Spirit Box response which Banshees do not have, then it's guaranteed to be a Mimic. ==Trivia== *The Mimic is the only ghost that can leave handprints on the Exit Door: it must be mimicking a Yurei, it must use the door-closing ability on the exit door, and the Ultraviolet evidence is not hidden. Hence, this occurrence is very rare. *It is impossible to get the Doom Slayed achievement against a Mimic due to it remaining in its \"blank\" state for 1 minute at the beginning of the contract and therefore cannot use the Demon's ability in the required timespan. *Since the new alphabetical sorting, the Mimic is sorted under 'the' before The Twins, rather than being listed before Moroi. This may throw people off when looking for the name. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !0.5.0 |Added The Mimic. |} ==References== ==Notes== Category:Ghosts fr:Le Mimic","title":"The Mimic","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mimic"}
{"content":"The photo camera is a piece of equipment in Phasmophobia. It is a digital camera that can be used to take pictures of objects in-game. While it is not used for gathering evidence, its main use is to gather photo evidence, as well as being necessary for certain objectives and tasks. ==Usage== The photo camera automatically turns on while held outside the truck. For the Tier II and III cameras, an additional display shows a preview of what the camera will capture at the moment it is used, and helps players frame the photo subject. Each photo camera can take an unlimited number of photos, but only the first 5 pictures taken will count towards earning rewards and completing objectives. Upon taking a picture, the flash will go off, and a photo preview will show up on the camera for Tier II and III cameras. Any pictures taken of a reflective surface will show the lens flash in the picture, such as a television, or the axe that one of the possible ghost models wields. The cooldown between photo depends on the Tier of the photo camera (3 seconds for Tier I, 2 seconds for Tier II, and 1 second for Tier III). Note that while the camera is cooling down, the player cannot switch to and use another item; they can, however, use items placed down/dropped on the floor. When a ghost manifests during a ghost event or a hunt, the photo camera's display will be distorted, as well as any pictures taken. Pictures taken in this state will still be labeled in the journal if a valid subject is detected. Holding a Tier II or III photo camera within 7.5 metres of a ghost (2.5 metres for the Yokai) during a hunt on the same floor will attract the ghost. The Tier I photo camera will only attract the ghost when a picture is taken. ===Rewards=== The first 5 labeled pictures recorded in the journal will reward the player with money and experience. Like other media evidence, the value of photos is determined by its Unique or Duplicate tag. While the first photo of a subject will grant full reward, additional photos of the same subject taken during the same contract will provide only 20% of the normal reward. If there are no available slots for photos inside the journal (which can hold 5 photos for the whole team), any further shots will not net any gains. If a shot is missed or judged unsatisfactory, players have the option to delete up to three pieces of media from the journal. In multiplayer, a majority vote from the players is required to delete a photo, signaled by a red icon on the Media tab of the Journal. ==Objectives== {| class=\"fandom-table\" !Objective !Actual requirements |- |Capture a photo of the ghost | - |} ==Gallery== <div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\"><gallery widths=\"185\"> Journal photo 0.5.1.0.png|Photos of various objects in the journal. </gallery></div> ==Trivia== *Captured photos are intentionally not synced over with other players, and are instead taken and rendered individually on each client to improve performance.

It became available in early access in September 2020 on Steam. In the game, one to four players take on the role of ghost hunters who work to complete a contract where they must identify the type of ghost haunting a designated site and complete other optional objectives. ==Gameplay== Players can choose to play alone or with up to three other players, the latter by creating or joining a server lobby. The host selects a difficulty level while any player can vote for a location and add equipment. The host can then start the contract when all players are ready. For each contract, the player is tasked to identify the ghost type, and three optional objectives are also assigned. To do this, the player must conduct an investigation, using their equipment to locate the ghost room and find various forms of evidence. This evidence must be recorded in the journal, which contains information about the different types of ghosts. Players can also use the characteristics of the different types of ghosts as recorded in the journal to identify the ghost. To complete other objectives, players may use equipment they have brought with them or items found on site. Some objectives depend on the ghost's activity, and the player can increase that activity by saying certain key phrases or the ghost's name. While the player is in the investigation area, their sanity gradually decreases, depending on their surroundings and certain activities that occur. As the player's sanity decreases, the ghost is more likely to initiate a hunt, where it will pursue players and attempt to kill them. During a hunt, exit doors will lock, forcing players to hide or escape the ghost for the duration of the hunt. A combination of equipment and strategies will be needed to stay alive. Players can leave whether or not the objectives have been met. After closing the truck door with all players alive inside, the contract will end and players will be rewarded with money and experience based on the completion of objectives and secondary evidence collected. These rewards can be used to purchase or unlock equipment and progress in the game. ==Availability== Phasmophobia can be purchased on the Steam Store, the Xbox Store, and the PlayStation Store. Officially, Phasmophobia supports Windows 10/11 and the Steam Deck. Unofficially, the game can also be played on Mac or Linux devices through other methods, or on Windows 7/8. Phasmophobia is compatible with any VR headset that supports OpenXR, such as Valve Index, HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. The game can also be played on Meta Quest via Air Link or Oculus Link. On PlayStation 5, it is compatible with PlayStation VR2. ==Controls== ==Gallery== <gallery widths=\"185\"> File:Tanglewood hallway.png File:School hallway.png File:Sunnymeadows corridor basement.jpg File:Shop 0.9.5.png File:Flickering 0.7.jpg File:Phastock.png </gallery> ==Trivia== *The word \"phasmophobia\" means fear of apparitions (as opposed to \"phantasmophobia\" which is the fear of real ghosts), but in modern usage it is most often used to refer to ghosts in general; the game was originally called Spectrophobia. Phasmophobia is considered the first early access ghost hunting game (previously and still sometimes lumped into the \"survival horror\" genre) that allowed direct communication with the AI via a microphone, and also the first game of its kind to use VR. *There is an unrelated game with a similar name called Phasmophobia: Hall of Specters 3D, which released in 2016.

{"content":"Sanity Medication is a purchasable item that is used to replenish a player's sanity. ==Mechanics== sanity medication will replenish a certain amount of the player's sanity up to the maximum of 100%, depending on difficulty: * Amateur: 40% * Intermediate: 35% * Professional: 30% * Nightmare: 25% * Insanity: 20% * Custom: 0% - 100% Consuming sanity medication will cause it to drop from the player's hand, and that item will no longer be consumable. Sanity medication cannot be consumed if the player's sanity is above 95%. Depending on the tier of the medication, the speed of restoration will differ (the tier does not change the amount of sanity restored). It is recommended to stay outside of the house/in the truck until the full sanity amount has been restored in order to accurately track sanity for hunts. * Tier I: 20 seconds * Tier II: 10 seconds * Tier III: 10 seconds ===Tier III sprint boost=== Once consumed, the Tier III sanity medication grants the player a sprint boost for 10 seconds, which means the player can run without exhaustion during that period. During the boost, the player can hear the heartbeat noise. After the boost, the user will normally consume the sprint stamina until they are exhausted. Consuming a Tier III sanity medication while a sprint boost is active doesn't extend the sprint boost time. == Tips == Strategically used, sanity medication can help to stave off hunts by bringing the average sanity back above the ghost's hunt sanity threshold. They can also be used to allow for further usage of cursed possessions such as Ouija Boards, to avoid breaking the possession. Sanity medication could even be used to identify ghosts based by seeing if they hunt above a certain threshold (e.g. Shade), or by performing a test for the Moroi. If one's aim is to delay hunts through sanity medication, specifically on multiplayer, one possible way to do this would be to distribute the sanity medication so that the overall sanity drain is slower on average. * For example, if just one player is at 0% sanity and the remaining players have enough sanity to be above the hunt threshold, then these remaining players should take the sanity medication instead of the 0% player. This would make it so that less players are reducing the average sanity of the entire team. * Another example is when all players are at varying levels of sanity; the players who tend to manage their sanity better could take the sanity medication, as long as this keeps the average sanity above the hunt threshold. Note that results may vary depending on factors such as the hunt sanity threshold, the ghost type, or players dying. Alternatively, Sanity Medication can be saved as an \"emergency ration\" for the last player(s) when multiple players have already died; this allows the surviving players to raise the average sanity higher than what would be possible when there are still more players alive, and possibly raise it above the hunt threshold when it wouldn't have been possible with more players. * For example, if all four players are at 0% sanity, and one player takes multiple Sanity Medication to raise their sanity to 100%, the average sanity would still only be 25%; if only two players are alive, then the average sanity would be 50% instead of 25%. Though a less common use (as Sanity Medication is often consumed in the truck and rarely brought into the investigation area), Tier III Sanity Medication can prove to be a potent tool in escaping the ghost during a hunt, as the player's sprint speed of 3 m/s is much faster than the speeds of most ghosts (barring ghosts such as Revenants or Thayes), and the player can easily outrun one while the sprint boost is active, allowing them to lose the ghost and get to safety while potentially rising their sanity enough to prevent another hunt from occurring. == Related difficulty settings == * Sanity pill restoration (%): The amount of sanity restored per sanity medication item ==Trivia== *Before 0.3.0, the substance labeled on the bottle itself was chlorpheniramine maleate, an antihistamine used to treat hay fever and allergy symptoms. == Gallery == <gallery> File:Sanity Pills.png|The old sanity pills packer bottles File:New Sanity Pills.jpg|The sanity pills packer bottlers before the truck's layout overhaul File:SanityPotion.png|The tier I sanity medication shown at the Lobby File:EctoAdrenaline.png|The tier III sanity medication shown at the Lobby </gallery> ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access Alpha |- !3 February 2020 |Painkillers are now consumed instantly. |- !4 February 2020 |Renamed Painkillers to Sanity Pills. |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |25 March 2020 |Sanity pills now have a slight delay before taking effect. |- |Sanity pills now have sound effects. |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |7 July 2020 |The sanity restored has been reduced from 50% to 40%. |- |Sanity pills will now be removed from the hand when consumed. |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |12 August 2020 |Sanity pills now cost $30 instead of $25. |- |Only 3 Sanity Pills can now be brought per contract, down from 4. |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |30 August 2020 |4 Sanity pills can now be brought per contract again, up from 3. |- |Sanity pills now cost $45 instead of $30. |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !0.3.0 |Changed the Sanity pills model. |- !0.4.0 |Sanity pills now restore different amounts of sanity depending on difficulty. |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |0.6.0 |Sanity pills now need to be re-bought when consumed. |- |Sanity pills now cost $20 instead of $45. |- !0.6.0.1 |Sanity pills no longer need to be re-bought when consumed. |- !0.8.0 |Sanity pills now drop to the ground once consumed. |- ! rowspan=\"3\" |0.9.0 |Sanity pills renamed to sanity medication. |- |Sanity Medication now has 3 tiers. |- |Sanity medication now needs to be re-bought when consumed. |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |0.10.0 |Reduced the sanity restoration time for tier I and tier II to 20 seconds and 10 seconds, respectively. |- |Tier III will now instantly refill your stamina in addition to keeping it full for 10 seconds. |}<br> Category:Equipment fr:Médicament de Santé mentale ru:Успокоительное","title":"Sanity Medication","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Sanity_Medication"}

The top floor opens out to a balcony that overlooks the surrounding environment. ===Layout tips=== *Point Hope is defined by its very linear structure: there is only ever one route to getting to a different area of the map. *The circular Balcony on the top floor has two doors that lead out to it, but the door that has a view of the sea below has a much shorter path to the stairwell that heads back down to Lantern Room Bottom. *These rooms cannot be chosen as the favourite room: **Bathroom Hallway **Master Bedroom Hallway **Child Bedroom Hallway **Balcony *The following rooms don't have any lights and hence don't prevent passive sanity drain: **Lantern Room Top **Balcony ===Key hiding spots and strategies=== There are 11 \"sanctioned\" hiding spots on Point Hope: *Entry Bathroom, in the shower *Entry Hallway, closet near the exit door *Living Room, small lighthouse tent *Living Room, closet near the living room entrance *Living Room, behind the opened crate below the stairs *Kitchen, behind the cardboard next to the washer *Dining Room, behind the boxes below the stairs *Master Bedroom, behind the room divider *Child Bedroom, cupboard *Maintenance Room, lockers *Lantern Room Bottom, behind the boxes near the stairs Depending on the difficulty, some of these hiding spots may be blocked by the presence of bulky items, be sealed behind locked doors, or have their concealing elements removed: *Amateur: None *Intermediate: 3 *Professional: 4 *Nightmare/Insanity: 6 *3-player game: +1 available hiding spot *4-player game: +2 available hiding spots <small>Additional hiding spots on multiplayer is overridden when \"Number of hiding places\" is set to None</small> ==Bone locations== Bones spawn randomly, but will only spawn in areas that a ghost can also walk on. ;Examples <div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\"><gallery widths=\"185\"> </gallery></div> ==Cursed possession locations== <div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\"><gallery widths=\"185\"> File:phope cards.jpg|The Tarot Cards spawn on Floor 1 on the table near couch.

These are encountered along the path ascending/descending Point Hope's height: *In the Living Room, opposite the closet hiding spot in the entrance hall. The hallway door may obscure it if it is opened all the way. *In the Kitchen, between the window and the stairs to the next floor. *In the Games Room, to the side of the window at the end of the stairwell from the Dining Room. *In the Master Bedroom Hallway, next to the hall light switch. ==Tips== *A single match in a box can be found in the Games Room on the fireplace. While usually irrelevant, it is useful to know where it is in case the player makes a mistake such as bringing in Incense or a Firelight without taking an Igniter. *Due to its linear layout, it can take extremely long to get from the entrance to a higher floor room such as the Lantern Room Top; coupled with a relatively fast sanity drain and a lower maximum number of lights that can be turned on due to its medium classification, this map can be deceptively difficult if the ghost selects a higher floor as its favourite room. **Extensive use of Firelights, and keeping on the hallway lights of floors on the way to points of interest such as the Ghost Room and Fuse Box (or, in the case of a ghost located towards the top of the building, about six or seven, in order to leave margin for a light source to be turned on, either accidentally by a player or by the ghost, without tripping the breaker), is strongly advised to help preserve sanity. *During a hunt, moving between floors can be very dangerous, especially if the location of the ghost room isn't known, both due to the map's linear structure and because the ghost's vocalizations will be muffled when it's on different floors. It is best to make note of which floors have available hiding spots, and which ones can be moved to without having to pass through where the ghost is likely to be on the way there. However, due to the lack of sight lines up and down the stairwells, escaping the ghost during a chase is quite feasible, as line-of-sight can be quickly broken simply by heading up or down a flight of stairs. *Some floors feature a large, solid pillar at the centre of them, which can be circled around and used to loop the ghost. These are best used to regenerate stamina and break line-of-sight to facilitate running up or down stairs. *While the first floor has by far the highest density of hiding spots among all floors on the map (just under half of the map's hiding spots are located either in the living room or the entrance rooms), hiding on that floor can be risky, especially if the ghost is also on the ground floor. Likely due to a bug, ghosts can and will enter the hiding spots unprovoked (both during and outside of hunts) - it is advised for players to have Incense ready if the ghost is roaming around a lot nearby. ==Easter Egg: Ferryman of the Drowned== Point Hope contains an easter egg that gives the \"Ferryman of the Drowned\" ID Card after leaving through the truck when triggered. In order to trigger the easter egg, the player will need at least one working UV light ready and complete the following steps on any difficulty: #First, the player needs to throw three different balls in the pool table in the Games Room in any of the holes in a certain order indicated by the coloured paintings near the stairs. The order is the following: green ball, blue ball, and orange ball (found next to the dark red one). After the balls have been holed in, the key to the lantern cabinet will drop at the ball exit. #The lantern cabinet in Lantern Room Bottom can now be unlocked. However, a cogwheel is missing inside. The latter can be found in the Maintenance Room which is the room below and the player can find it leaning against a shelf to the right of the lockers. The player needs to pick it up and it into the cabinet. #Once the cogwheel has been inserted, the lighthouse's lantern will now blink periodically instead of having a continuous lighting. The player now needs to ring the large bell next to the entrance three times which will make a fire-like noise in the distance of the map. #The player must now head back to the very top of the lighthouse, go to the balcony, and look towards the island where a cave entrance with the letters \"UV\" will be visible with a bright fire. #Finally, the player will have to shine the UV light against the large lantern until the lantern's light turns purple. Only one player in a game has to complete this as everyone in the lobby will receive the reward, regardless of who actually completed it. ==Trivia== *This map has been teased throughout the development of the game. Many hints included newspapers in the truck referencing to three keepers who disappeared, a lighthouse being added to Maple Lodge Campsite in 0.6.0, Runes added in 0.8.1.0 teasing the name \"Point Hope\" when deciphered, and a map added in 0.9.1.0 on the wall in Maple Lodge Campsite's reception building designating the lighthouse as being the \"Point Hope Lighthouse\". The map was unintentionally confirmed on the 10th of December 2023, when the weekly task \"Complete Objectives on [Map Name]\" required it to be done on Point Hope. On the 3rd of January 2024, a development preview was released, officially revealing Point Hope as well as providing two screenshots of the interior. *Two Blåhaj plushies can be found in the Child Bedroom. *From left to right, the maritime signal flags in the Child Bedroom spell out \"GET OUT\". *The commemorative plaque at the front door states that the lighthouse was constructed in the \"Province of Massachusetts\" in 1802, making Point Hope the first map to be connected to a tangible, real-world location. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !0.10.0 |Added Point Hope. |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |0.10.1.0 |The lantern room has been split into different ghost rooms to avoid confusion and fix sensor placement: *Lantern room top *Lantern room bottom |- |The fuse box on Point Hope will now only spawn in the entry house, kitchen, games room, and master bedroom floors. |- !0.12.0.1 |Point Hope is now classed as a medium map. |} ==References== Category:Maps fr:Point Hope ru:Point Hope Category:Medium Map","title":"Point Hope","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Point_Hope"}

The amount of money gained from ghost identification, optional objectives, recorded media, and any investigation bonus(es) is then multiplied by the difficulty multiplier: *Amateur: 1x *Intermediate: 2x *Professional: 3x *Nightmare: 4x *Insanity: 6x *Custom: 0x - 15x depending on settings If the player does not identify the correct ghost on a custom difficulty, their rewards will be rounded down to the nearest default difficulty (e.g. from 7x to 6x, which is the Insanity multiplier). Difficulty multipliers below 1x are not affected. If the player is dead when the investigation ends, the difficulty multiplier is not applied if it is higher 1x, and the money earned is halved. If the resulting money is not an integer value, it is then rounded down to the nearest integer. A summary of all the money earned in a game will be displayed on the contract payment board after completing a contract. ===Insurance=== If a player is dead when the investigation ends, all equipment that they added to the mission is lost, unless the \"Lose items upon death\" difficulty setting is turned off. Insurance will reimburse dead players with a portion of the money spent on purchasing those items. The percentage of money paid out is dependent on the difficulty of the contract: {| class=\"article-table\" !Difficulty !Money refunded |- |Amateur<br>Difficulty multiplier ≤ 1x |50% of the value of all the added items |- |Intermediate<br>Difficulty multiplier ≤ 2x |25% of the value of all the added items |- |Professional<br>Nightmare<br>Insanity<br>Difficulty multiplier > 2x |Nothing |} Insurance money is not multiplied by the difficulty multiplier. ==Notes== *Picking up the bone and taking a picture of the bone are not the same. Each one of these actions rewards the player with money but they are not linked one to another. This means that the player can pick up the bone for the money or take a picture for the money without doing the other action. The picture of the bone will be registered in the Pictures section of the game summary, and picking up the bone will be registered in the Bone evidence category. *Insurance payout is not affected by whether a photo of the dead player's body is taken. ==Trivia== *Given that the game is set in the United States, it is implied that the currency used is the US Dollar. *The limit on the amount of money one can have is $2,147,483,647 (2<sup>31</sup> − 1), the maximum value of a Int32 variable (that is used to store the player money in the save file). *The theoretical maximum amount of money you can earn from a single contract (excluding Daily and Weekly Tasks) is $14,261, by completing a perfect game on the highest difficulty multiplier with Blood Moon weather on large maps. When additionally completing 4 of the most rewarding daily tasks (only on the 2nd, 11th, and 25th of each month) and 3 weekly tasks awarding $500 each, the absolute maximum money is $16,211.

{"content":"The Myling is a type of ghost in Phasmophobia. It is distinct for being more talkative, but very quiet when hunting. ==Behaviour== ===Activity=== The Myling produces a paranormal sound (groaning/laughing/talking/whisper) on a Parabolic Microphone or a Sound Recorder every 64 - 127 seconds, instead of every 80 - 127 seconds for other ghosts. ===Hunt=== When hunting, a Myling's footstep and vocalization sounds will only be audible to players within 12 meters – slightly greater than the range required for electronic interference – instead of the usual 20 meters. The volume of footsteps is slightly muffled near the limit, but quickly becomes discernible as it approaches. ==Evidence== ==Strengths and weaknesses== These are the strengths and weaknesses as listed in the journal: Strength: A Myling is known to be quieter when hunting. Weakness: Mylings make more frequent paranormal sounds. ==Strategies== ===Behavioural identification=== The best way to identify a Myling is taking advantage of the small difference between its audible range (12m) and the electronic interference range (10m), and having a rough intuition of these ranges. If the ghost's sounds are very faint or not audible at all at the threshold of the interference range, then it is probably a Myling. Note that this test is not valid if the ghost is on a different floor, since this will muffle the audible range. This can be tested in multiple ways, such as: *Before a hunt, dropping an active electronic equipment at your preferred hiding spot, then looking for the behaviour during the hunt *Holding an active electronic equipment or using during a hunt, with incense for protection Note that the Raiju has a larger interference range (15m), which may create a similar effect. Use other methods (such as ghost speed) to eliminate the Raiju. ;Paranormal sounds If two paranormal sounds are picked up within 80 seconds on a Parabolic Microphone or a Sound Recorder, then it is a Myling. ===Surviving hunts=== On larger maps, especially in long hallways, it is prudent to visually look out for the ghost, as its reduced audible range gives it a mild advantage in catching a player off guard, while also gaining speed for longer if line-of-sight was achieved; alternatively, a Parabolic Microphone renders this a non-issue, as it will detect the ghost's footsteps and vocalizations if it is in range, regardless of whether it's a Myling or not. <!--=== Indicators === *Note that there may be an occasional bug where the ghost temporarily does not flicker electronics on the correct floor when changing floors. (check if still exists)--> ==Trivia== *In Scandinavian folklore, Mylings (pronounced “mai-ling” { /ˈmaɪlɪŋ/ } or “me-ling” { /ˈmiːlɪŋ/ } for a more traditional pronunciation) are ghosts of children who were either killed by their parents, unbaptised, or abandoned. Because they were not baptized, Mylings cannot rest and are forced to roam until they can persuade a living being to carry them or their body to hallowed grounds where they can rest peacefully. Failure to meet a Myling’s demands will result in them killing the benefactor. In-game, the Myling's age and ghost model are randomly chosen, and the ghost does not have to be of a young age. *Another way that the Myling can find peace is if it can find and kill its mother. Usually it needs to be either carried by someone or get a form of \"permission\" to move/search from a relative in order to move from its burial place. This permission is usually obtained by trickery or vague wording of the request. They are usually depicted as small children in a early stage of decay (swollen and discoloured skin) but can choose to appear as adult if that was the age they would have been had they been alive. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !0.3.0 |Added Myling. |- !0.7.0 |Myling will now decrease the audible range of its hunt audio, instead of only footsteps. |}<br> ru:Мюлинг fr:Myling Category:Ghosts","title":"Myling","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Myling"}

{"content":"The voodoo doll (or tortured voodoo doll) is a cursed possession used to force the ghost to perform interactions. ==Mechanics== The voodoo doll has a 1 in 7 chance, per contract, of being chosen as the cursed possession that will appear with one specific spawn location per map. Interacting with the voodoo doll will cause one of the 10 pins stuck in the doll to be pushed into it at random. This will cause the ghost to perform an interaction, and will drop the user's sanity by 5%. These forced interactions can include EMF Level 5 and Ultraviolet sources, but not the Ghost Writing Book. If the heart pin is pushed in, the user's sanity will drain by 10%, and the ghost will initiate a cursed hunt. If the user interacts with the voodoo doll while at 0% sanity, all remaining pins will be pushed in and a cursed hunt will also occur. ===Rewards=== Taking a photo of a voodoo doll will yield a photo labelled as Voodoo Doll and reward up to $7 and 7 XP, depending on the tier of the Photo Camera. ==Tips== *The voodoo doll can either be used to find the favourite room, by listening to where the interaction happened, or after the favourite room has been found, to force the ghost to interact with evidence sources rather than waiting extended periods for the ghost to do it on its own. *If the player is trying to force the ghost to give Ultraviolet evidence, items in the room can be removed to stop the ghost from interacting with those instead of a Ultraviolet source. *As each use has a risk of causing a cursed hunt, players should either stay in a safe location, or have Incense ready and/or have an intact Tier 3 Crucifix in the favourite room. *When using the voodoo doll with no sanity, all pressed remaining pins may cause multiple objects to be thrown at the same time. Be mindful of this to not confuse the ghost with a Poltergeist. ==Trivia== *Prior to its introduction as a cursed possession in version 0.5.0, the voodoo doll was initially a decorative prop found only on some specific maps (namely the original versions of Grafton Farmhouse and Bleasdale Farmhouse, as well as 13 Willow Street). Voodoo dolls could be photographed as photo evidence, but they otherwise had no use or effect on gameplay, even though some rumors claimed that they could anger the ghost if taken outside, or that they would always land facing the ghost room when thrown on the ground. *The Voodoo Doll was available as official merchandise for a limited time, until 11 April 2023 (UK time).

Be mindful that most but not all sinks are functional sinks. One can verify if a sink is functional by with the tap.

{"content":"Tripods are used to mount video cameras, essentially acting as a portable surface for them. ==Usage== Picking up a video camera and it on top of the tripod will mount the camera on the tripod. Carrying the tripod afterwards will bring the camera along as well, so the player does not need to carry both an empty tripod and an unmounted video camera. The video camera can be removed from the tripod by it. A tripod can be placed by it, making it drop below the player in the direction they are facing. Tripods can also be placed via the key; holding this key will show a translucent outline of its placement, which can be adjusted by moving the mouse left or right. Tripods are bulky items, and thus take up your hand slot while carrying it; they cannot be stored in your inventory, and switching to another item or hand while carrying a tripod will automatically drop the tripod. Additionally, tripods will hinder player movements when walked through, forcing player to more carefully chose where to place them. The tripod will allow players to position video cameras in places where no suitable surface is available, and will also reduce the likeliness of the ghost knocking over the camera than if it was placed down on its own. The stability of the tripod against ghost tampering will depend on its tier. Additionally, Tier II and III tripods have a motorized mount, allowing to rotate the camera left or right by using the arrows in the bottom right corner of the computer in the truck. ==Strategies== *The rotation feature of the Tier II and III tripods may allow players to observe the entirety of the room with a single camera, allowing to more easily find Ghost orbs or track the ghost during a hunt. ==Trivia== *The Kinetic Games logo can be spotted on the back side of the tier III tripod. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access Alpha |- !19 June 2020 |Tripods are now level-locked. |- !17 September 2020 |Tripods can no longer be placed on the VR inventory belt. |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !0.7.0 |Tripods can now be rotated or placed. |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |0.9.0 |Divided into three upgrade tiers. |- |Ghosts can now knock over tripods. |- !0.10.0 |Tripod I knockdown chance increased from 20% to 30 % and Tripod II knockdown chance increased from 10% to 20% |} Category:Equipment fr:Trépied ru:Штатив","title":"Tripod","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Tripod"}

{"content":"The Mimic is a type of ghost in Phasmophobia. They are known for mimicking the traits of other ghosts. ==Behaviour== ===Ability=== The Mimic is able to imitate any type of ghost, and inherit all of its features and abilities: *Interaction and ghost event rates and preferences *Hunt thresholds *Hunt movement speeds *Various forms of special abilities (e.g. Poltergeist multi-throw, Demon ability hunt) When imitating a type of ghost, The Mimic will not copy its types of evidence, and will not necessarily provide its guaranteed type of evidence on reduced-evidence difficulties such as Insanity, but can copy features related to evidence. For example, it is able to copy the Obake's six-fingered handprints or the Deogen's breathing, as The Mimic has Ultraviolet and Spirit Box as evidence, but it cannot copy the Goryo's trait of only appearing on a Video Camera when interacting with a D.O.T.S Projector, as The Mimic does not have D.O.T.S Projector as one of its types of evidence. The Mimic will always start in the \"blank\" state (in which it essentially mimics itself) at the beginning of a contract. When this is the case, it will act as a default ghost and have no special abilities. It will attempt to change 1 minute after an exit door has been opened for the first time, then every 30 seconds to 2 minutes, but cannot change during hunts and ghost events. Additionally, The Mimic cannot imitate the Banshee or the Dayan if it is male. If The Mimic is affected by Incense, it will not be able to hunt for the duration associated with the ghost it was imitating at that moment, even if it imitates another ghost before its end. The Mimic, when imitating some specific ghost types, will have some specific behaviours, listed below: *If The Mimic imitates a Thaye, a fixed age between 0 and 10 is randomly selected, and it will imitate another ghost using its own timer instead of the Thaye's ageing timer. *If The Mimic imitates a Moroi, and curses the player through the Spirit Box, the Parabolic Microphone, or the Sound Recorder, the curse will remain even if The Mimic switches to another ghost type. *If The Mimic imitates a Banshee, initially, it has no target. Once the first non-cursed hunt is attempted, a target is chosen randomly. The Mimic provides \"evidence\" of Ghost Orbs in addition to its three main evidence types, which also appear on difficulties with reduced evidence, including zero evidence. These Ghost Orbs, along with the other types of evidence if none are hidden due to the difficulty, will always exist regardless of the type of ghost that The Mimic chooses to imitate, and will behave in exactly the same way as those produced by other ghost types and will only levitate in the ghost room. ==Evidence== Though Ghost Orbs are always present, this is not considered by the Journal when inputting evidence. Whether Ghost Orbs is selected does not affect your payout even if the ghost is blanked out when selecting the ghost. ==Strengths and weaknesses== These are the strengths and weaknesses as listed in the journal: Strength: We're unsure what this ghost is capable of. Be careful. Weakness: Several reports have noted ghost orb sightings near mimics. ==Strategies== The Mimic's fundamental nature means that it is extremely unpredictable; it might mimic a Shade and be scared to hunt the whole contract, or it could mimic a Moroi and rapidly drain everyone's sanity then turn into a Revenant and wreak havoc with a surprise early hunt. It can theoretically have the powers of almost any ghost type at any time, most notably ghost abilities that could enable early hunts. In theory, the absolute safest way to handle a Mimic is to treat it as if it had every potential modifier that could increase its aggression/drain player sanity faster than usual, and utilize all tactics that would be used to dissuade attacks from other ghost types: *Aggression-related: **Try to minimize speaking when near the ghost (Yokai) **Turn off electronics that are no longer needed (Raiju) **Make sure to have active sources of flame in the Ghost Room (Onryo) **In general, be prepared for the possibility of early hunts (Demon/Thaye) *Sanity-related: **Avoid colliding with the ghost during an event (Oni) **Turn the breaker off (Jinn) **Avoid being in pseudo line-of-sight of the ghost (when the player hears their own heartbeat) (Phantom) **Remove items from the ghost room (Poltergeist) **Close doors in the ghost room (Yurei) In practice, however, it is oftentimes overkill and a great annoyance to perform all of these at once, with some even conflicting with each other, and most of the time it's simpler to just bring in Crucifixes early to stop any surprise hunts and/or take Sanity Medication to refill sanity as needed. Additionally, it is prudent to have Incense handy, as The Mimic may imitate fast ghosts such as the Revenant or Thaye, catch players by surprise by starting a hunt from an unexpected location if it imitates The Twins or a stalking ghost (Wraith, Phantom and Banshee), or most dangerously imitate the Deogen and require players to completely change up their strategy from hiding to looping between hunts, potentially after everyone is already situated at a hiding spot. As The Mimic always produces Ghost Orbs and appears to go over the difficulty's maximum amount of given types of evidence, players have to take care when trying to identify the ghost through evidence. However, this can also cause The Mimic to be very simple to identify, as players only need to confirm an additional type of evidence compared to the difficulty. On difficulties with all three types of evidence, identifying Ultraviolet, Spirit Box and Ghost Orbs also definitively indicates a Mimic, as no other ghost has this evidence combination. Ghost behaviour is also a relatively easy, if somewhat luck-dependent way to identify The Mimic; if the player spots conflicting ghost behaviour throughout the contract that seems to indicate different ghosts at different times, it is most likely The Mimic changing between different ghost types. Similarly, identifying the behaviour of a specific ghost type, but then getting types of evidence that it does not have, gives The Mimic away. For example, if the player hears a Banshee's scream on the Parabolic Microphone, but also gets a Spirit Box response which Banshees do not have, then it's guaranteed to be a Mimic. ==Trivia== *The Mimic is the only ghost that can leave handprints on the Exit Door: it must be mimicking a Yurei, it must use the door-closing ability on the exit door, and the Ultraviolet evidence is not hidden. Hence, this occurrence is very rare. *It is impossible to get the Doom Slayed achievement against a Mimic due to it remaining in its \"blank\" state for 1 minute at the beginning of the contract and therefore cannot use the Demon's ability in the required timespan. *Since the new alphabetical sorting, the Mimic is sorted under 'the' before The Twins, rather than being listed before Moroi. This may throw people off when looking for the name. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !0.5.0 |Added The Mimic. |} ==References== ==Notes== Category:Ghosts fr:Le Mimic","title":"The Mimic","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mimic"}
{"content":"The Twins is a type of ghost in Phasmophobia. They are known for existing as a \"pair\", with both Twins able to interact with the environment and start hunts \"separately\". ==Behaviour== Despite its name and accompanying flavor text, mechanically, The Twins is simply one ghost. This means there is no \"decoy twin\" to: *Set off motion sensors or step in salt *Produce evidence of Freezing Temperatures (or even affect temperatures to begin with) or Spirit Box *Perform ghost events or hunts at the same time ===Ability=== When The Twins tries to interact, one of the following occurs: *50% chance of performing one interaction within the normal range (up to 2.12 metres on small and medium maps, and up to 4.24 metres on large maps). *30% chance of performing one interaction within a larger range (up to 8.48 metres on small and medium maps, and up to 16.97 metres on large maps). *20% chance of performing its ability, which produces two interactions, one in each range, in a timespan of 1 or 2 seconds. All such interactions follow the standard 1/3 (33%) chance of producing EMF Level 5 instead of 2 or 3, regardless of which range was used to perform the interaction. ===Hunt=== As The Twins is only one ghost, two hunts cannot occur simultaneously, and it will follow the standard 25-second cooldown between hunts. When The Twins attempts to initiate a hunt, it will first perform a crucifix check at its current location before choosing to have a slow (1.5 m/s) or a fast (1.9 m/s) base speed, with each having a 50% chance. If choosing to be slow, the hunt will begin at its current location; if choosing to be fast, it will teleport close to the area where it last interacted with the large range and will hunt from there. Regardless of where The Twins hunts from, it will follow standard hunting rules. If a cursed hunt is triggered, The Twins will always hunt from the current location, but it still has a 50% chance of selecting either base speed. ==Evidence== == Strengths and weaknesses == These are the strengths and weaknesses as listed in the journal: Strength: Either Twin can be angered and initiate an attack on their prey. Weakness: The Twins will often interact with the environment at the same time. ==Strategies== The Twins' primary strength is its ability to misdirect: its core ability can very easily conjure red herring interactions at parts of the map far from the favourite room where it would give evidence, misleading hunters and delaying their efforts to identify it. This can be especially troublesome on larger maps like Sunny Meadows Mental Institution when trying to locate the favourite room. However, these misleading interactions can be used against it: as the ghost is not physically in the room where these long-ranged interactions occur, any indication of the ghost past EMF Level 5 cannot be obtained in the area. Using a thermometer and noting a lack of Freezing Temperatures (or, at the very least, notable temperature drops) where ghost activity is noted, failing to receive Spirit Box responses in rooms near where interactions occurred, or not being able to detect it with Motion Sensors/Salt are strong signs of the antics of The Twins trying to cause trouble. One can identify The Twins by spotting back-to-back interactions with less than 2 seconds of delay, as other ghosts need at least 2 seconds before performing another interaction. Noticing a subtle change in base speed from one hunt to another might indicate that the player is dealing with The Twins. Be sure to avoid confounding factors such as line-of-sight acceleration, or a few other ghosts which may also change base speeds between hunts. Both Twins also have a slightly different speed than the normal base speed of 1.7 m/s, which allows particularly experienced hunters to identify it from one hunt simply by noticing said difference; players should be careful of relying too much on this method though, as a few other ghosts can have a similar base speed, most notably a Moroi which has a speed of 1.915 m/s between 20% and 25% average sanity, nearly indistinguishable from The Twins' 1.9 m/s. Due to The Twins having two possibilities in regards to angles of attack for any given hunt, it is recommended to plan for the event that The Twins approaches from a planned escape route, such as through use of Incense. Additionally, as The Twins checks for a crucifix in its current location before teleporting to the location of its last large range interaction if it decides to be fast during the hunt,<ref name=\"twins\" group=\"note\"/> this can lead the ghost to begin a hunt directly on top of a crucifix, something no other ghost can do (outside of a cursed hunt). Identifying hiding spots in the ghost room may also come in handy (if there is one available), as players can simply hide inside the ghost room if The Twins hunts from outside the room. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !0.4.0 |Added The Twins. |} ==Notes== Category:Ghosts fr:Les Jumeaux ru:Близнецы","title":"The Twins","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/The_Twins"}
{"content":"Spirit Box is a type of evidence in Phasmophobia. It is used to determine which type of ghost is inhabiting a location. Its corresponding piece of equipment is the Spirit Box. ==Obtaining== Spirit Box evidence can be obtained through its equipment counterpart by asking the ghost various questions while it is enabled. There are some conditions to this, however: *The player must be in the same room as the ghost. *The player must be within range of the ghost (3 metres with a Tier I Spirit Box, 4 metres with a Tier II Spirit Box, and 5 metres with a Tier III Spirit Box). *All ambient lighting in said room must be off. Adjacent rooms do not need their lights disabled, and equipment doesn't need to be turned off. *Ghosts who respond only to \"people who are alone\" will only respond if there is only one player in the room. Otherwise, the number of players in the room does not matter. If these conditions are met, the ghost will have a chance to respond. {| class=\"mw-collapsible mw-collapsed fandom-table\" !colspan=\"2\"|Advanced mechanics |- !colspan=\"2\"|WARNING: This data is not officially verified. |- !Answer chance |The response chance depends on the spirit box tier: 50%, 60%, 70% for tiers 1, 2, 3, respectively. |} ===Possible questions=== There are three main categories of questions that differentiate the responses a ghost will give to players: *Aggressiveness *Location *Age Given the nature of voice recognition, questions may be marginally different from one another, so the following lists only contain general phrases that should be used as a guide. ====Aggressiveness==== Ghost responses are threatening with murderous intent. {| class=\"mw-collapsible mw-collapsed fandom-table\" !Aggressive questions |- |\"Are you friendly?\" |- |\"What do you want?\" |- |\"Why are you here?\" |- |\"Do you want to hurt us?\" |- |\"Should we leave?\" |} ====Location==== Responses will correspond to the location of the ghost relative to the player. {| class=\"mw-collapsible mw-collapsed fandom-table\" !Location related questions |- |\"Where are you?\" |- |\"Are you close?\" |- |\"Give us a sign.\" |- |\"Speak to us.\" |- |\"Can you talk?\" |- |\"Are you here?\" |- |\"Is there a Ghost here?\" |- |\"What is your location?\" |- |\"Show yourself.\" |} ====Age==== Responses will detail the ghost's predetermined age. {| class=\"mw-collapsible mw-collapsed fandom-table\" !Age related questions |- |\"How old are you?\" |- |\"Are you a child?\" |- |\"Are you old?\" |- |\"Are you young?\" |} ===Possible answers=== The player may try to extract information from these audio snippets, but they're not always intelligible enough. For example, when a voice saying \"a young individual\" is heard after asking for the ghost's age, it is safe to assume the ghost is young.

{"content":"Temperature affects several gameplay aspects within Phasmophobia. ==Mechanics== The ambient temperature of a map, both indoors and outdoors, is dependent on the weather. Each weather type will have a specific ambient temperature that is set at the beginning of each contract. There are 4 groups of weather used to determine the ambient temperature. From warmest to coldest: *Sunrise: *Clear, Fog, Blood Moon: *Light Rain, Heavy Rain, Windy: *Snow: Before the investigation area/building is entered, all rooms will be at the ambient temperature. Though, in Amateur difficulty, all rooms will start at their maximum temperature. The ghost will not affect the temperature of its current room until an exit door is opened. When a player is in a room that is at or below , their breath will be visible. ===Affecting temperature=== After an exit door is opened, temperatures of all rooms will change dynamically. Temperatures increase at 0.025°C (0.045°F) per second, and decrease at 0.1°C (0.18°F) per second. Temperatures will decrease at 1/3 of this rate once it is below the ambient weather temperature. If the fuse box is off, all applicable rooms will return to the ambient temperature. If it is on, these rooms will slowly increase in temperature until . Only indoor building rooms are affected by the fuse box. Outdoor areas, including tents and outdoor bathrooms in campsites, are not affected. The room that the ghost is currently in will slowly decrease in temperature to a minimum of , regardless of the fuse box's state. It will slowly increase if the ghost leaves the room. The temperature of a room can be read by a thermometer. The value of the reading will fluctuate upwards from the actual room's temperature by a maximum of 3°C (5.4°F) with a tier I or II thermometer, and by a maximum of 2°C (3.6°F) with a tier III thermometer. When lit, Camp Woodwind's campfire instantly raises the temperature of its \"room\" to , even if the ghost is in that room. The campfire itself will usually exceed . This does not apply to Maple Lodge Campsite's campfires, which is likely a bug. ===Ghost abilities=== The Hantu's speed during a hunt is affected by the temperature of the room it is currently in.

{"content":"Experience (or XP) in Phasmophobia is used to unlock various equipment and difficulties. ==Mechanics== Each player starts off at level 1 with 0 XP, and earns XP through finishing contracts. The experience required to level up increases progressively, and the level is capped at 9,999. Once level 100 has been reached, the player can choose to Prestige, which will wipe out their level, money, and equipment, in exchange for a new badge and title for the ID Card. The ID Card lists the number of levels the player has and the amount of XP required to reach the next level. The amount of XP earned each contract is displayed on the debriefing screen. ===Gaining experience=== Players may gain XP from the following sources: {| class=\"article-table mw-collapsible\" !Task completed !colspan=\"2\"|XP rewarded |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Ghost identification |Small map |100 XP |- |Medium map |150 XP |- |Large map |200 XP |- |Objectives 1 - 3 |colspan=\"2\"|25 - 30 XP per successful objective |- |Media |colspan=\"2\"|Up to 231 XP |- |Investigation Bonus |colspan=\"2\"|If the player identifies the correct ghost and escapes alive, XP = Ghost identification + Completed objectives |- |Perfect Investigation Bonus |colspan=\"2\"|50 XP on top of Investigation Bonus |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Bone Evidence |Small map |25 XP |- |Medium map |35 XP |- |Large map |50 XP |- |Blood Moon weather |colspan=\"2\"|+10% |} To get the additional Perfect Investigation Bonus of 50 XP, the player must identify the correct ghost, complete all 3 objectives, collect the bone, and fill the journal with only unique media. The amount of experience gained from identifying the ghost, completing optional objectives, recorded media, and any investigation bonus(es) is then multiplied by the difficulty multiplier: *Amateur: 1x *Intermediate: 2x *Professional: 3x *Nightmare: 4x *Insanity: 6x *Custom: 0x - 15x depending on settings If the player does not identify the correct ghost on a custom difficulty, their rewards will be rounded down to the nearest default difficulty (e.g. from 7x to 6x, which is the Insanity multiplier). Difficulty multipliers below 1x are not affected. If the player is dead when the investigation ends, the difficulty multiplier is not applied if it is higher than 1x, and their experience gained is halved. If the resulting EXP is not an integer value, it is then rounded down to the nearest integer. ===Level progression=== Players will unlock more equipment, difficulty levels, and maps as they progress.

If nothing happens upon asking a question, it is possible the game did not recognize any valid phrase, or the player's voice recognition is not working properly. Note that the microphone LED/icon shows whether the game is picking up the player's microphone only if the player's voice chat option is set to Voice Activation. When using \"System Voice\", this does not necessarily mean that the system is working properly. ===Answering=== When a question is successfully registered, the Spirit Box will return one of two results: *If all the relevant conditions are met and the chance is successful, the ghost LED will turn white on a Tier I Spirit Box, the ghost icon will display on a Tier II Spirit Box, the response LEDs will turn white on a Tier III Spirit Box, and a distorted voice line will be heard through the Spirit Box. This is considered as evidence of Spirit Box. *If the ghost LED turns red on a Tier I Spirit Box, the 'X' icon displays on a Tier II Spirit Box, or the response LEDs turn red on a Tier III Spirit Box, one or more of the conditions listed below have not been met. {| class=\"mw-collapsible mw-collapsed fandom-table\" !colspan=\"2\"|Advanced mechanics |- !colspan=\"2\"|WARNING: This data is not officially verified. |- !Answer chance |The response chance depends on the spirit box tier: 50%, 60%, 70% for tiers 1, 2, 3, respectively. |} ===Evidence requirements=== In order to get a successful Spirit Box response from the ghost, all of the following is required: *The ghost has Spirit Box as one of its types of evidence. *The player must be in the same room as the ghost. *The player must be within a certain range of the ghost (3 meters with a Tier I, 4 meters with a Tier II, and 5 meters with a Tier III). *All lights in said room must be off. Light emitted from equipment, including electronic and non-electronic equipment, does not affect this. Lights in other rooms, including rooms or hallways that are directly adjacent, may be left on, and any doors between the rooms can stay open. *Ghosts which respond only to \"people who are alone\" will respond only if there is a single person in the room at the moment the question is asked. If the ghost is noted to respond to everyone, the number of people in the room does not affect the ghost's ability to respond. If the difficulty has a setup time (e.g. Amateur and Intermediate), this will be indicated on the cork board and in the journal. *If all other conditions are met, there is a chance of the ghost responding per question asked. The chance depends on the tier of the Spirit Box. If the player is particularly unlucky, a combination of these factors may cause the Spirit Box to repeatedly turn the LEDs red, or show an 'X', despite the ghost having Spirit Box as one of its evidences. Other than the need for the Spirit Box to be near the player, there are no further checks on where the Spirit Box itself is. ===Interference=== The Spirit Box is considered an electronic equipment. When interfered with, all the LEDs/icons will flicker rapidly. During a hunt, holding an active Spirit Box within 7.5 meters of a ghost on the same floor will attract it to the player. Note that the ghost may still respond audibly if the player asks questions while the Spirit Box is being interfered with. This also counts as Spirit Box evidence. ===Non-evidence=== The following does not count as evidence of Spirit Box: *The ghost touching a door or an object *The ghost performing a ghost event or a hunt, which may cause the LEDs/icons on the Spirit Box to flicker **One ghost vocalization involves the ghost repeatedly saying certain words; this is also not evidence of Spirit Box *Any other phenomenon not related to the Spirit Box ===Ghost-specific abilities=== *The Deogen has a 33% chance to respond with heavy breathing instead of a regular response if the player is standing within 1 meter of the ghost. *The Moroi will curse the player who asked a question if they successfully obtain a response. The cursing response will not sound any different. ===Rewards=== Successfully recording a Spirit Box response will yield a Spirit Box Response sound in the journal, rewarding up to $12 and 12 XP, depending on the tier of the Sound Recorder and whether there is a Unique stamp. Additionally, a Deogen Breathing can also be recorded, also rewarding up to $12 and 12 XP. ==Tips== *It is recommended that the Spirit Box be used early on in the investigation as soon as the presumed favorite room has been found, as using it effectively requires a player to remain alone in the dark with the ghost for several seconds, thus considerably reducing their sanity and allowing a potential hunt to start. This is especially true for higher difficulties. *As the Spirit Box emits a constant static when turned on, it may interfere with the ability to hear ghost activities properly, and the ghost can also interrupt players talking normally if the game interprets a phrase as a question; Turning it off is recommended when not in use. *Ghost replies on the Spirit Box do not count as ghost events or interactions. *It is possible to obtain a Spirit Box response from a ghost that has it among its types of evidence during a ghost event or a hunt. ==Possible ghosts== {| class=\"article-table\" |+ |Dayan |Spirit Box |EMF Level 5 |Ghost Orb |- |Deogen |Spirit Box |D.O.T.S.

{"content":"Ultraviolet is a type of evidence created by ghosts that can be used to determine the ghost type. ==Mechanics== Ultraviolet evidence consists of fingerprints and footprints which can be revealed by using a UV Light. ===Fingerprints=== By default, each interaction on a valid surface will always produce a fingerprint. Exceptions include with the Obake which has a 25% chance to hide them, or when using the \"Fingerprint chance\" custom difficulty modifier to reduce the odds. A ghost with Ultraviolet evidence will leave behind fingerprints when it interacts with the following surfaces or items: *Most types of doors *Light switches and lamps *Windows *Keyboards *TV remotes *Cooler boxes *Mirrors (specific maps only) The Prison map has additional places where fingerprints may be left behind: *On the horizontal surface of a bar of cell doors *On the steel keyhole surface of cell doors Maple Lodge Campsite and Camp Woodwind also have additional places where fingerprints may appear: *Bases of lanterns *Interior edges around large tent door flaps/tops of small tent door flaps *Picnic benchtops *String light poles Lights flickering or interactions caused by ghost events will not result in a fingerprint being left behind in these instances. Depending on the surface area of the object being interacted with, either a fingerprint or a handprint will be visible. Fingerprints will disappear completely after 2 minutes, or 1 minute on Insanity difficulty. This can be changed using a custom difficulty setting. Additionally, the Obake can sometimes use an ability to reduce the remaining time for all existing fingerprints on the map by half. There are 18 different fingerprint patterns, including 3 which are unique to the Obake. When leaving fingerprints on surfaces it touches, an Obake has an approximately 16.7% chance to leave a non-standard pattern: *A handprint with six fingers instead of five *Two fingerprints instead of one on light switches, lamps, and TV remotes *Five fingerprints instead of four on keyboards and Prison doors For each type of door or surface that a fingerprint is possible, the fingerprint will always appear in the same spot. In addition, most doors of the same model will always have the fingerprints on only the push or pull side, but not both. For example, all Farmhouse-style doors will always have the fingerprints on the top-right corner of the door, and only appear on the \"push\" side. There are a few exceptions to these two rules; for example, one street/road house-style door may have the fingerprint on the \"push\" side while another identical door has it on the \"pull\" side, though they will always appear on the middle of the door. ===Footprints=== When a ghost moves any time within 10 seconds after it steps in a salt pile, it will leave a footprint with each step until it stops moving, and each footprint will produce a footstep sound and disappear after 10 to 15 seconds. If the ghost doesn't have Ultraviolet as evidence, or the evidence is hidden, its footprints will be invisible. *The Obake has a 25% chance each step to hide the footprint, creating no footstep sound when successful. Because of the random nature of the game, a ghost may step in a salt pile and choose to stop moving immediately, creating no footprints in that instance. Footprints left by the \"lamprey-faced\" child ghost model are slightly smaller than those left by other ghost models. ===Rewards=== Taking a photo of a fingerprint or a footprint that has been charged using a UV Light will respectively yield a photo labelled as Fingerprint or Footprint, each rewarding up to $7 and 7 XP, depending on the tier of the Photo Camera and whether there is a Unique stamp. Keep in mind, however, that the prints will slowly fade before becoming completely invisible after the player stops charging them with a UV Light. Invisible prints cannot be photographed and will result in an invalid photo. Each instance of a fingerprint, including repeat fingerprints on the same surface, can only be photographed once. ==Possible ghosts== {|class=\"article-table\" |Banshee |Ultraviolet |D.O.T.S.

For this to happen, the ghost must be The Mimic, it must be mimicking a Yurei, it must use the door-closing ability on the exit door, and the Ultraviolet evidence is not hidden. Hence, this occurrence is very rare. ==Related difficulty settings== *Fingerprint chance (%): The chance of a ghost leaving fingerprints when interacting (only shows when Evidence given is not 0) *Fingerprint duration (s): The duration of fingerprints before they disappear (only shows when Evidence given is not 0) ==History== {|class=\"fandom-table\" !colspan=\"2\"|Early Access Alpha |- !29 January 2020 |Fingerprints now only show on doors that have been interacted with by the ghost rather than being on walls. |- !19 March 2020 |Fingerprints can now appear on windows. |- !11 August 2020 |Fingerprints can now appear on light switches. |- !colspan=\"2\"|Early Access |- !0.2 |Fingerprints can now appear on Prison keyboards. |- !0.3.0 |Updated footprint visuals. |- !rowspan=\"3\"|0.4.0 |Fingerprints now disappear after 60 seconds. |- |Fingerprints are now left only 75% of the time. |- |Added a new fingerprint design for Maple Lodge Campsite. |- !rowspan=\"3\"|0.4.1.0 |Increased the fingerprint duration to 2 minutes. |- |Fingerprints are now left 100% of the time again. |- |Fingerprints can now be found on more surfaces in Maple Lodge Campsite. |- !rowspan=\"2\"|0.6.0 |Added new fingerprint designs. |- |Fingerprints can now appear on house keyboards. |- !rowspan=\"3\"|0.8.1.0 |Fingerprints will now slowly fade out, instead of disappearing instantly. |- |Footprints now fade over time, instead of disappearing instantly. |- |Improved fingerprint and footprint rendering. |- !rowspan=\"5\"|0.9.0 |Renamed Fingerprints evidence to Ultraviolet evidence. |- |Footprints now count as Ultraviolet evidence. |- |Salt will now only reveal footprints if the ghost has Ultraviolet evidence |- |Renamed Footsteps photo to Footprints |- |Footprints will be affected by ghost traits similar to Fingerprints |- !0.10.0 |Ghosts can now leave single fingerprints on all small lamps and TV remotes in all locations |} Category:Evidence fr:Ultraviolet ru:Отпечатки","title":"Ultraviolet","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Ultraviolet"}
{"content":"The Wraith is a type of ghost in Phasmophobia. Wraiths are best known for their purported ability to \"fly\" and \"walk through walls\", actually referencing to them not stepping on a salt pile and their ability to teleport to players randomly. ==Behaviour== ===Activity=== The Wraith will never step in a salt pile, and therefore will never disturb them. This includes Tier III Salt during hunts, rendering it ineffective against one. ===Ability=== When the Wraith is not hunting, it has a chance to teleport to a random player, generating an EMF Level 2 reading at the location where it teleported to, at the level of the targeted player's feet, with a 33% chance for this to be an EMF Level 5 reading instead. The Wraith will resume normal behaviour after teleporting. ===Miscellaneous=== Wraiths cannot and do not: *Float off the ground, whether during hunts or manifestations. A Wraith cannot be identified by looking at its ghost model. *See through physical objects such as walls and doors. *Walk quietly; Wraiths will emit footstep noises at the same volume as most other ghosts. *Walk through walls, even during hunts; they can only walk through doors (which all other ghosts are also able to do). *Actively avoid moving over salt; they do not try to path around salt piles, and will simply ignore any piles entirely. ==Strengths and weaknesses== These are the strengths and weaknesses as listed in the journal: Strength: Wraiths almost never touch the ground, meaning it can't be tracked by footsteps. Weakness: Wraiths are afraid of Salt and will actively avoid it. ==Evidence== ==Strategies== ===Identification=== ====Salt test==== The Wraith will never step in or disturb a salt pile. If you've had undisturbed salt in the ghost's room for a prolonged period of time, then it could be a Wraith. This can be used to identify a Wraith deterministically: either during a fake hunt ghost event, when it appears in D.O.T.S, or during a real hunt, place salt in front of where the ghost is about to step. If it does not disturb the salt pile despite passing directly through it, then it is a Wraith. Note that a Gallu can also pass through a salt pile without disturbing it if it is enraged. Placing salt in the center of the Summoning Circle and then summoning the ghost is a good way to spot a Wraith. Alternatively, one could place a line of salt across a tight access route where the ghost is highly likely to pass through (e.g. a doorway for/in the ghost's room), then place a motion sensor or two on the doorway. If the ghost passes through the motion sensor(s) but never steps in the salt, then it is likely a Wraith. Note that the salt should be tightly packed enough (but not wasteful) such that a ghost that passes through is otherwise virtually guaranteed to step on the salt. Tier II or tier III salt makes this work easier since they are placed in a long pile. ====Teleportation==== The Wraith's teleporting behaviour may give rise to otherwise odd behaviour, such as: *Interactions happening far away from the favourite room and near where a player currently is (or recently was) *Seemingly random EMF level 2 or 5 readings which could not have been caused by any interaction, especially far away from the favourite room The Banshee and Phantom can also roam/walk (but not teleport) to a player, while The Twins can interact with objects far away, and of these other culprits only the Phantom can create these apparently random EMF readings when moving to a player, but it will never leave EMF level 5 readings as it does not have that as evidence and the EMF reading will be located at head level; a random EMF level 5 reading or a random EMF level 2 reading at ground level most certainly indicates a Wraith. Meanwhile, having the roaming frequency setting on Medium or High may induce similar behaviour. If desired, one could use motion sensors to see where the ghost actually is (moving) when it performs such an interaction. ===Hunt=== Although the Wraith teleporting does not by itself trigger a chance to hunt, it could possibly hunt from the location it teleported to if it meets normal hunt requirements. This makes being almost anywhere within the investigation area dangerous once average sanity is low enough; avoid being caught off guard by the Wraith starting a hunt nearby. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access Alpha |- !18 March 2020 |Wraiths now require Freezing Temperatures instead of Dirty Water as one of its evidences. |- !22 March 2020 |Wraiths no longer leave footsteps when hunting. |- !23 March 2020 |Wraiths will now emit footstep noises when hunting, but not footprints. |- !25 March 2020 |Wraiths can now leave footprints by stepping on a salt pile. |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !22 September 2020 |Wraiths no longer interact with salt piles during hunts. |- !22 September 2020<br>(Part 2) |Wraiths no longer leave footprints after stepping on a salt pile.

{"content":"13 Willow Street (or simply Willow) is a map in Phasmophobia. It is a small, single-story home with two bedrooms and one bathroom, as well as a small garage and a basement. It is one of the smallest maps in the game, being only slightly larger than 6 Tanglewood Drive, but feels almost tiny due to its spacious open rooms, a sharp contrast to the generally congested environments of the other suburban homes. Willow can often make for a swift investigation due to its small size, but the lack of lockers, closets, and easily-accessible side rooms to hide in makes it relatively dangerous during a hunt. As such, players will have to learn the ins and outs of hiding behind furniture in order to survive. ==Structure== Willow consists of two bedrooms, one bathroom, a garage, and a large basement, among other rooms. See Third-party tools for a list of detailed map viewers that players may use. ===Key hiding spots and strategies=== Willow does not contain any closets or lockers, but 8 organic hiding spots are available: *Living Room, behind stacked storage crates in corner next to fireplace *Garage, behind shelf in laundry area *Garage, behind stacked storage crates along far wall *Garage, behind upright plywood in corner (when covered from side and front) *Boys Bedroom, behind stacked storage crates in back corner next to white wardrobe *Master Bedroom, behind black wardrobe (only when chair is next to it and facing the opposite corner) *Basement Hallway, behind trash cans at far end *Right Storage Room, behind blue tool cart Depending on the difficulty, some of these hiding spots may be blocked by the presence of bulky items or have their concealing elements removed: *Amateur: None *Intermediate: 3 *Professional: 5 *Nightmare/Insanity: 7 *3-player game: +1 available hiding spot *4-player game: +2 available hiding spots <small>Additional hiding spots on multiplayer is overriden when \"Number of hiding places\" is set to None</small> Several more unofficial furniture-based hiding spots are available. While they are more risky, they will never be blocked unlike official hiding spots, and can still provide decent hiding in most cases. Examples include: *Master Bedroom, behind the desk *Living Room, right against the bookshelf. While a decent replacement for the official hiding spot by the fireplace, it remains a risky option if the ghost wanders into the living room. Looping the ghost may be performed around the pickup in the garage, the kitchen island or around the two shelves in the Right Storage Room. The living room couch can also be used loop partially to move towards the kitchen if needed. ==Bone locations== Bones spawn randomly, but will only spawn in areas that a ghost can also walk on. ;Examples <div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\"><gallery widths=\"185\"> Bone willow hallway.png|A long bone in the Hallway.

{"content":"The Thaye is a type of ghost in Phasmophobia. It is known to exhibit paradoxical activity spans when nearby players, ranging from that of an Oni to that of a Shade the longer at least one player stays in its vicinity. ==Behaviour== ===Ability=== The Thaye has an internal \"age\" parameter that affects its general activity. The Thaye will attempt to age 1 minute after an exit door is opened for the first time; if at least one player is in the same room as the ghost or within 3 meters of it, the Thaye will add 1 to its age and re-attempt to age after 1-2 minutes, else it will re-attempt to age after 30 seconds. If the Thaye successfully uses this ability during a hunt, the age increase will only be effective after the hunt. The following shows the parameters that are affected by age: {| class=\"article-table\" ! Behaviour ! Age 0 (Initial) ! Per age added ! Age 10 and higher |- ! Hunt sanity threshold | 75% | -6% | 15% |- ! Hunt speed | 2.75 m/s | -0.175 m/s | 1 m/s |- ! Relative interaction/ghost event rate | 200% | -15% | 50% |- | colspan=\"4\" | {| class=\"article-table mw-collapsible-content mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"text-align:center;\" width=\"100%\" |+Detailed behaviour per age !Age !Hunt sanity threshold !Relative activity rate !Hunt speed |- |0 |75% |200% |2.75 m/s |- |1 |69% |185% |2.575 m/s |- |2 |63% |170% |2.4 m/s |- |3 |57% |155% |2.225 m/s |- |4 |51% |140% |2.05 m/s |- |5 |45% |125% |1.875 m/s |- |6 |39% |110% |1.7 m/s |- |7 |33% |95% |1.525 m/s |- |8 |27% |80% |1.35 m/s |- |9 |21% |65% |1.175 m/s |- |10+ |15% |50% |1 m/s |} |} For every age added, the Thaye's \"human age\" as provided by the Ouija Board increases by 1 - 4. Unlike ghost activity, there is no (reasonably attainable) limit on the Thaye's \"human age\". The Thaye's starting \"human age\" can still be anywhere from 10 - 90, like all other ghosts. Once the Thaye has used its ability 9 times, it will no longer be able to perform ghost events unless forced through the use of cursed possessions. ===Hunt=== Unlike most other ghosts, the Thaye does not speed up with line-of-sight of a player. == Strengths and weaknesses == These are the strengths and weaknesses as listed in the journal: Strength: Upon entering the location, Thaye will become active, defensive and agile Weakness: Thaye will weaken over time, making them weaker, slower and less aggressive ==Evidence== ==Strategies== With a Thaye, both interactions and events will be more frequent from the start of the investigation, which may make it easier to locate the ghost. On the other hand, if players do not locate the ghost quickly, especially on large maps, the Thaye may prove to be one of the most dangerous ghosts in the game, as its initial hunt sanity threshold is higher than that of a Demon's, and it is much faster when chasing players during these early hunts. Due to the extreme danger it can pose towards the beginning of a contract, identifying hiding spot locations as soon as possible is very prudent. Once the ghost has been located, setting up ghost writing books and D.O.T.S Projectors to try and get their evidences early may help, especially on Nightmare where one evidence is hidden; if the ghost gives both Ghost Writing and D.O.T.S Projector, then it will either be a Thaye or an Obambo, as the Deogen, the only other ghost to share those two evidence types with the aforementioned, has guaranteed Spirit Box as one of its pieces of evidence. One must be careful not to confuse the Obambo's two distinct hunt speeds and polarising sanity thresholds (based on its state) with the Thaye's slowing and progressively-lowering hunt sanity threshold as it ages. One could identify a Thaye through its hunting behaviour; if it is fast early in the contract, slows down over several hunts as players continue spending time near it, and does not gain speed with continuous line-of-sight (LOS), then a Thaye is likely. Unlike a Thaye, the Obambo does gain speed with continuous LOS, making this a clear way to differentiate the two. Likewise, if the ghost hunts early and has high levels of activity, but becomes less willing to hunt, interact, or perform ghost events over time, this could also point to a Thaye. Because ghost events and interactions are more common early on, one should use this opportunity to complete any non-hunt related objectives or fill the journal with photos. Taking the hunt sanity threshold into consideration, if one is careful with how they interact with the ghost, a (near-)perfect contract can be achieved easily. However, if players spend excessive time in the ghost room and cause the Thaye to age quickly, and are not careful with their cursed possession usage to compensate for the loss in activity, completing objectives and obtaining photo evidence could become an annoying (or boring) task. Hunt-related objectives on the other hand are best left for when the ghost has aged enough that it is no longer a major threat; after aging 4 times, a Thaye will be slower than the player's average speed if continuously sprinting off-cooldown, and after aging 3 more times (for 7 times in total), it will be slower than the player's walking speed, allowing it to be easily looped. Staying in the ghost room for a period of time to age them to safe levels, then using a cursed possession to force a hunt is a safe way of completing many objectives such as escaping the ghost during a hunt. ==Trivia== *Thaye (IPA: /θəjɛ́/, pronounced \"thuh-yeh\") are also known as sarai and tasei in Burmese (written သရဲ) are disembodied spirits in Myanmar folklore that have many forms at once, depending on the beholder. They come in the deep of the night and cause minor nuisances. *When The Mimic mimics a Thaye, it will choose a random age. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !0.6.2.0 |Added Thaye. |- !0.6.2.1 |Adjusted the Thaye's weakness. |- !0.9.0 |The Thaye no longer has an increased chance to interact with the D.O.T.S.

{"content":"The Spirit is a type of ghost in Phasmophobia. They are unique among other ghost types for not having any distinctive strengths. ==Behaviour== ===Activity=== When Incense is used near a Spirit, it will not be able to initiate a hunt for 180 seconds instead of 90 seconds with most other ghosts. Like other ghosts, this will not prevent cursed hunts. This delay will also apply if the Spirit was smudged during a hunt. Spirits have no other special behaviour. ==Evidence== ==Strengths and weaknesses== These are the strengths and weaknesses as listed in the journal: Weakness: A Spirit can be temporarily stopped by burning Incense near them. ==Strategies== With no special powers, and a harsher reaction to Incense, Spirits serve as a baseline to measure other ghosts against. With their behavior not being especially unique amongst the ghosts, its overall lack of defining traits can confuse investigators; therefore, unless clear evidence is established, a Spirit can be easily mistaken for another entity. The main (and usually only) way to test for a Spirit without using evidence is to lower the average sanity to below 50%, and smudge the ghost while it is hunting; if it hunts again before the three minutes is up, it is not a Spirit. If it hunts only after three minutes, it is very likely (though not conclusively) a Spirit. Note that if it hunts within the first minute of the smudge stick being used, then the smudge stick did not work, and the player should attempt to smudge it again. In Nightmare/Insanity difficulty, players should wait for a hunt or a burnt crucifix to confirm that the average sanity is low enough. A more reliable way to test for Spirit is using incense near the ghost, start a timer and wait for around 160-170 seconds and then use incense near the ghost again. Using motion sensors can be helpful to determine the position of the ghost. Due to the incense's cleansing effect not being re-applied if a current one is ongoing, two scenarios can happen: *If the ghost hunts within the next 60 seconds of the second incense, the ghost is a Spirit. *If the ghost hunts after 60 seconds but before 90, it is still likely to be a Spirit, but it may also be a Demon instead, though this is not likely to be an issue, as a Demon will most likely initiate a hunt before the second incense is even used, ruling out the Spirit. ==Trivia== *Although the journal says that the Spirit is the most common ghost, all ghost types actually have the same chance of getting selected by the game. **Perhaps this description was thought to mean that the Spirit is the \"basic\" ghost type other types were based upon in the process of development. *The Spirit is the first ghost in the list and is automatically selected at the start of each contract by default. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access Alpha |- !13 March 2020 |Spirit now requires Fingerprints instead of Bug as one of its evidences. |- !10 September 2020 |Spirits can now be prevented from hunting for 3 minutes when a Smudge Stick is used. |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !0.3.0 |Prior to 0.3.0, the evidence was Spirit Box, Fingerprints, and Ghost Writing. |} Category:Ghosts fr:Esprit ru:Дух","title":"Spirit","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Spirit"}

{"content":"The thermometer is a piece of starter equipment used to read the temperatures in the nearby environment, and is the primary tool for detecting Freezing Temperatures. ==Usage== ===Tier I=== The Tier I Thermometer passively reads out the temperature of the last room in which the player held it, with the red liquid (alcohol) within slowly rising or falling depending on if the room is colder or warmer than where it was before. While very slow to update, with a rate of 0.33°C per second, it benefits over its upgraded versions by being both completely passive, and is not an electronic item that could attract the ghost while held during a hunt. The thermometer reads out both Celsius (°C) and Fahrenheit (°F), with Celsius values on the left side and Fahrenheit on the right. The reading will fluctuate from the actual value by a maximum of +3 degrees, in Celsius. ===Tier II=== The thermometer can be to turn on the display. Holding down the button will make the thermometer read the player's current room's temperature in degrees Celsius (°C) every 2.5 seconds. This can be changed to Fahrenheit (°F) in the settings. The reading will fluctuate from the actual value by a maximum of +3 degrees, in Celsius. ===Tier III=== Similar to the Tier II thermometer, it can be to turn on the display, and can be used to give a reading by holding down the use button. Compared to the Tier II thermometer, it is much faster to give a read-out, only taking 1.5 second between each reading. By default, the reading will be in degrees Celsius (°C); this can be changed to Fahrenheit (°F) in the settings. The reading will fluctuate from the actual value by a maximum of +2 degrees, in Celsius. ==Tips== *Temperatures readings below the weather's ambient temperature (e.g. below 5°C in snowy weather) is generally an indication that the ghost is in (or was recently in) the room. *The tier II and III thermometers will continuously give out new readings when players hold after the initial reading while the tier I thermometer will refresh constantly, although at a much slower speed. *When using thermometers thrown on the floor, turning it off and on again or moving between rooms before attempting to read the temperature may help to reduce the risk of errors. ==Trivia== *The tier III thermometer is actually a Therma-Hygrometer which can also measure the air humidity; the design of the tier III thermometer is based off the THS-224-612 Therma-Hygrometer. *The tier III thermometer displays \"EMS 0.95\" on its screen, but EMS (Emissivity) is a measure for thermal radiation, and is used for infrared thermometers like the tier II thermometer.

{"content":"The UV light is a buyable starter item used to detect Ultraviolet evidence such as fingerprints and footprints. ==Usage== The UV light can be enabled using the key while holding it. The UV light can be activated at the same time as a standard flashlight, but any visible fingerprints or footprints may contrast poorly and be hard to see under their light. The UV light projects purple light and this light is weak relative to flashlights. The Tier I and III UV Lights will not work if Flashlights are turned off in custom difficulty settings. Ghosts that give ultraviolet evidence can leave prints on certain surfaces doors, light switches, and windows. They may also leave prints on floors after stepping through salt. These prints become visible and green when a UV light is shone towards them. The Tier I UV Light is a flashlight with a narrow spotlight. It counts as an electronic equipment. So it will flicker rapidly near a manifesting ghost and will attract the ghost during a hunt when it is nearby. Tier II UV Light is a small glowstick. When activated, it glows brightly for 1 minute, then fades to half intensity over the next 10 seconds. After dimming, the glowstick can be shaken with to revitalize the light it produces. The tier III UV Light is also a flashlight. However, it has a much wider spotlight and a lesser charge time than tier I. It also counts as an electronic equipment. ==Tips== *As of patch 0.9.0, UV prints must be illuminated by a UV light to take a successful photo. *Many regard the Tier II UV Light as superior to the Tier I and III versions, due to the fact that the player can simply throw the glowstick on the floor and it will continuously illuminate any prints nearby, and it is also not an electronic, allowing the player to use it as a light source during hunts without the ghost detecting it. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access Alpha |- !28 August 2020<br>(Part 3) |Added glowsticks. |- ! colspan=\"2\" | Early Access |- ! rowspan=\"3\" |0.3.0 |Changed the glowstick model. |- |The glowstick now fades after a short while. |- |Changed the UV flashlight model. |- !0.3.0.1 |The glowstick now fades to half intensity over 10 seconds after 1 minute. |- ! rowspan=\"3\" |0.9.0 |UV light now has 3 tiers. |- |The glowstick has been repurposed as the Tier 1 UV light. |- |After it dims, the glowstick can now be shaken to revitalize the light it produces. |- !0.10.0 |Swapped tier I and tier II UV Light. |} Category:Equipment Category:Starter Equipment fr:Lampe UV ru:Ультрафиолетовый свет","title":"UV Light","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/UV_Light"}
{"content":"The shop is used to buy and sell items, add them to the contract, and create loadouts. == Usage == The shop can be accessed from the main menu by navigating using the keyboard arrow keys, or clicking the right arrow from the main menu. The shop can also be directly clicked on. Pressing Esc or Space, or clicking the left arrow will exit the shop. The shop is divided in three pages that can be accessed on the left of the screen. These pages are \"Shop\", \"Equipment Manager\", and \"Quick-Loadouts\". The player's current level and money are listed at the top right-hand corner of the screen. === Shop === The Shop page allows players to buy equipment. Each piece of equipment has a tile that displays the quantity of it the player currently owns and its price. Clicking on the different tier buttons will show the piece of equipment's description, properties, and the buttons to buy, sell, or upgrade said piece of equipment. === Equipment Manager === The Equipment Manager page allows players to add and remove equipment from the contract. To add a piece of equipment to the contract, the player needs to click on its + button. Clicking on its - button will remove it from the contract. Starter equipment is colored in white while each player's equipment is represented as a different color that can be customized in the options. Changing the piece of equipment's tier can be done by clicking on one of the tier buttons. Each player can only bring one tier of equipment. If the host changes their tier of a main equipment, the starter equipment will also be changed to that tier. === Quick-Loadouts === The Quick-Loadouts page allows players to create loadouts that can be added to the contract. By default, players can set 2 loadouts. Additional loadout slots can be unlocked by prestiging, up to 8 additional slots. In each loadout, players can click the + and - buttons in the \"Amount\" column next to each piece of equipment to add or remove it from the loadout. The tier buttons in the \"Tier\" column will set the piece of equipment's tier in the loadout. The \"All\" row can increase or decrease the tier of all equipment at once, and add or remove one of each piece of equipment from the loadout. In the \"All\" loadout, only the tier of each piece of equipment can be changed. The loadout is automatically saved every time a change is made to it. Each loadout also can be renamed, except for the \"All\" loadout. Once the player is satisfied with the loadout, they can choose to enable it, which will automatically buy the missing pieces of equipment in the loadout and add it to the contract each time they load into a lobby. Once enabled, the loadout will have a checkmark icon next to it. A warning icon will appear instead and prevents the player from using it if they haven't unlocked a specific piece of equipment in the loadout, or if they don't have enough money to cover the loadout's costs.

{"content":"The Sound Monitor is a screen in the Truck labelled \"Sound Sensors\". The screen will list up to 4 separate sound sensors in a horizontal bar graph format. When placing sound sensors inside a playable area, it will label the sensor on the sound monitor according to in which area it was placed. Sound sensors pick up the sound level in an area around it, indicated by the associated orange graphic of their radius on the Site Map. Sounds picked up on the sensors will show as a yellow bar indicated in percentage, depending on the volume of the noise detected, and it will play a live audio feed into the Truck, potentially allowing for Evidence such as EMF Level 5 and Ghost Writing without having to be inside the building. 0.1 dB picked up on a Parabolic Microphone is equivalent to 1% on the Sound Monitor. Using sound sensors and keeping an eye on the sound monitor can be useful in finding the ghost's location early.

{"content":"Voice chat is the primary mode of communication in Phasmophobia. ==Player chat== Voice chat is used to communicate between players. Phasmophobia uses the Vivox voice chat system. Dead players can hear living players, but not the other way round. Due to a bug, dead players can sometimes not hear each other clearly. ===Local chat=== Local chat is proximity-based. Players can hear one another up to 20 metres away, though in reality this distance is usually shorter due to volume fall-off. There are three settings available for players to communicate through: *Push-to-talk: The game will hear the player while they hold the button. *Voice Activation: The game will always hear the player; this is also known as open mic. *Toggle: The local chat button is used to toggle open mic on or off. A microphone icon in the bottom-left corner of the screen will light up when the game is listening. A throat-clearing sound can also be heard when toggling; a rising tone when toggling on and a falling tone when toggling off. This setting can be adjusted via the settings in the journal or in the main menu. Players in different locations may hear local chat as being muffled: *Players on different floors *Players that are inside versus outside a building During a hunt, any noise transmitted through the microphone that is loud enough (when local chat is enabled) will attract the ghost if it is within 9 metres (or 2.5 metres for a Yokai) of the player on the same floor. This does not affect voice recognition. ===Global chat=== Global chat allows the player to communicate to all players on-site, regardless of their location. Global chat can be activated by holding the button, or by grabbing the walkie-talkie when using VR headsets. Voice through global chat will be muffled in a manner similar to a walkie-talkie. The VR walkie-talkie will automatically return onto the belt when dropped. Global chat can only be activated via push-to-talk. Global chat cannot be used by dead players or in the lobby. Dead players can hear living players through global chat. Using global chat within 9 metres of a ghost (2.5 metres for a Yokai) during a hunt will attract the ghost to the player, regardless of whether the player is speaking or not. Doing this will also cause a static noise to be played for all players in lieu of any microphone audio. One player using global chat will not attract the ghost to other players, regardless of if the speaker is inside or outside the investigation area. ==Voice recognition== Voice recognition is used for recognition of phrases said by the player to elicit reactions from the ghost. Players can change the voice recognition system that is used (\"Voice\" or \"System Voice\"), as well as the voice recognition language. While \"Voice\" supports all existing languages that are available on the game, \"System Voice\" only supports English, French, German, Japanese, Chinese, and Spanish. Both local and global chat work normally. When voice recognition is set up correctly, the player can use either local or global voice chat to communicate with the ghost using the Spirit Box, the Ouija Board, or the Monkey Paw. Additionally, saying the ghost's name or recognised phrases after having spent 2 seconds near the ghost also has a chance of increasing ghost activity, which includes interactions, roaming, and abilities. It will also increase the Spirit Box's response chances. This has a minimum cooldown of 10 seconds. When using Push-to-talk or Toggle modes, valid phrases will still be recognized even if the mic is activated slightly after (~0.5 seconds) saying that phrase. The following is a list of recognized phrases: <div style=\"-moz-column-count:3; -webkit-column-count:3; column-count:3;\"> *\"Give us a sign.\" *\"Do something.\" *\"Let us know you are here.\" *\"Make a noise.\" *\"Make a sound.\" *\"Can you make a sound?\" *\"Open a door.\" *\"Open the door.\" *\"Open this door.\" *\"Turn on the light.\" *\"Turn off the light.\" *\"Show us your presence.\" *\"Show your presence.\" *\"Show me.\" *\"Show us.\" *\"Knock something.\" *\"Throw something.\" *\"Can you speak?\" *\"Can you speak to us?\" *\"Can we speak?\" *\"Would like to speak to you.\" *\"Can I ask you?\" *\"May I ask you?\" *\"Would you like to talk?\" *\"Talk to me.\" *\"Talk to us.\" *\"Scream.\" *\"Do you know who we are?\" *\"We mean you no harm.\" *\"We are friends.\" *\"Is there anyone with me?\" *\"Is there anyone here?\" *\"Are there any ghosts?\" *\"Are you male or female?\" *\"Are there children here?\" *\"Are you alone?\" *\"Are you the only one here?\" *\"Are you here all the time?\" *\"Are you waiting?\" *\"Are you happy?\" *\"Is there anything that I can do?\" *\"Is this your home?\" *\"Do you want us to leave?\" *\"I'm scared.\" *\"I am scared.\" *\"Scared\" *\"Scare\" *\"Scary\" *\"Spooky\" *\"Horror\" *\"Fright\" *\"Frighten\" *\"Panic\" *\"Hide\" *\"Run\" </div> <br>Note that some of these phrases were tied to older mechanics, so they don't all make sense with the game's current context. Additionally, not all of these may be functional. If the player is unable to use voice recognition, they may use the text option for the Ouija Board, the Spirit Box, and the Monkey Paw. ==Tips== *Players who are unable to use voice recognition may consult the official Phasmophobia Discord server's voice recognition help channel on potential ways to fix voice recognition. *Some languages on the \"Voice\" system may not work correctly; use the \"System Voice\" recognition system or \"Text\" system as an alternative. *If you are using the \"System Voice\" recognition system, there is a bug where voice recognition (not voice chat) may \"fall asleep\" when the player loses focus of the game, causing it to fail. Pressing the Windows key twice, or pressing once and clicking on the game icon in the taskbar, will \"wake\" it up. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |0.4.0 |Static from global chat now plays during hunts only if the ghost is near the player. |- |Ghosts can now detect players using global chat without speaking during hunts. |- !0.5.1.2 |Open mic is no longer forced on singleplayer. |- !0.6.0 |Local voice chat now has three options: voice activation, push-to-talk, and on/off toggle. |- !0.6.2.0 |Switched the voice recognition system from a Windows-based system to an internal system. |- !0.6.3.0 |Added the option to switch back to the Windows-based voice recognition system. |- !0.10.1.0 |The multiplayer voice chat system has been changed from Photon Voice to Vivox. |- !0.11.1.2 |Voice recognition modes have been reworded for better in game translation. *VOSK has been changed to Voice *Windows Voice has been changed to System Voice |} ==References== Category:Gameplay Category:Settings fr:Chat vocal","title":"Voice chat","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Voice_chat"}
{"content":"Weather is a mechanic intended to enhance gameplay and affect temperatures within the map. ==Mechanics== There are currently eight types of weather. Seven among which one will be randomly chosen per game with equal chance, and an additional eighth type that has a 2% chance to replace the chosen weather. Depending on what weather type is present, players may experience auditory and visual obstructions. Weather is grouped into four groups of temperatures. From warmest to coldest: * Sunrise * Clear, Fog, Blood Moon * Light Rain, Heavy Rain, Windy * Snow This can affect how the player finds the ghost; warmer weather means that the average room temperature where the ghost is will be slightly higher than in colder weather. The effects of weather are suppressed while indoors: noise disruption (save for the occasional roar of thunder) is quieted, and the visual effects of fog and precipitation do not make their way inside. However, weather can play a major part in Camp Woodwind and Maple Lodge Campsite, precisely as these maps are mainly played outside. ==Sunrise== overlooking the lake on Sunrise Weather.]] The sun is rising on the horizon (it does not actually move), casting golden rays onto the map, which may improve illumination in certain areas.

{"content":"This page lists special events that have occured within Phasmophobia. Some events will give out trophies, which will be displayed in the lobby. <!-- ==Halloween 2021== ==Christmas 2021== --> ==2022== ===Easter 2022=== During this event, each map had a fixed number of easter eggs spawn in fixed locations. Players could pick them up to collect them. Once all the eggs in the map had been collected, the sanity of all players would be restored to 100%. ===Halloween 2022=== An interactive event was introduced for Halloween 2022. In this event, some maps would have a fixed number of carved pumpkins containing candies, similar to Easter 2022. These maps were indicated by a jack o' lantern symbol in the contract selection board. To complete each map, the player had to be on Nightmare difficulty (not a custom Nightmare preset) and do the following in order: *Collect all the candies. *After all the candies are collected, new carved pumpkins would spawn, requiring players to light them up with a lighter. *Once both of these are done, the ghost will now show up with a pumpkin head for the remainder of the contract. The player(s) must then take a photo of the ghost. The photo does not have to be labelled nor be the first ghost photo as long as the ghost is technically in the photo. Each time a step was completed, a laughing sound would play. The player did not have to survive as long as all the steps were completed. If the map's weather was Heavy Rain, the player had to start a new contract, as some pumpkins were located outside and thus could not be lit. Completed maps would have a check mark on top of the pumpkin label. Once the activity had been done across all the maps containing the pumpkins, the player was rewarded with a pumpkin trophy. This event lasted from 0.7.1.0 until 0.7.1.5. Aside from this event, the lobby and the truck also had various decorations. ===Holiday 2022=== During this event, the lobby was decorated with various Christmas decorations. A temporary challenge was also added. Similar to the Trick or Treat event, participating maps would feature a Holiday Sticker on the map selection board on Intermediate difficulty. The player was then required to visit all 7 maps and do the following on each map: #Collect 6 cookies to add them to a plate #Place the completed plate near the ghost #Wait for the ghost to eat the cookies; this will cause the player's vision to darken, and a hunt starts after their vision clears if they are in the investigation area. The ghost will now appear for the remainder of the contract with a Christmas garb as the one seen from Christmas 2021, and the weather will turn to snow. #Correctly identify the ghost and leave alive After completing all the maps, the player would receive a Holiday '22 Badge (for the ID Card) and Trophy. The maps could be done in either singleplayer or multiplayer. This event was introduced with the Tempest update (0.8.0) and ended on 9 January 2023 (0.8.0.7). ==2023== ===April Fools 2023=== On 1 April 2023, a same-version hotfix (0.8.1.3) was released to add some new features: *Player and ghost model heads are now comically big *Most ghost vocalisations are now sped up and have a higher pitch *Other players now appear to T-pose by default **Consequently, all their photos are taken upside down *Ghosts will occasionally appear in T-pose (such as during certain ghost events or when producing a D.O.T.S Projector silhouette) This lasted the whole 24 hours of the day (UK timezone), and was reverted afterwards. ===Easter 2023=== An event was introduced for Easter 2023. Similar to the Trick or Treat and the Holiday 2022 events, participating maps would feature an Easter Sticker on the map selection board. The player was required to visit all 7 small maps and do the following on each map: *Collect all the hidden Easter eggs. Once all eggs were collected, a laughing sound would play, indicating that the objective has been completed. Compared to other holiday challenges, this could be done on either singleplayer or multiplayer, on any difficulty (including custom difficulties of any multiplier, even 0x), and there was no need to find the ghost type or acquire a ghost photo. The player only needed to be alive the moment the last egg was picked up, and could be dead at any other time. After completing this objective on all maps, the player would receive an Easter '23 Badge (for the ID Card) and Trophy. This event lasted from 0.8.1.4 until 0.8.1.6. ===Halloween 2023=== An event was introduced for Halloween 2023. Similar to previous events, participating maps would feature a Pumpkin Sticker on the map selection board. The player could visit all 9 maps and do the following on each map: *Find the recipe ingredient note found in a pumpkin's mouth. Once the player knew the full recipe, they could proceed to add the ingredients to the cauldron found in Maple Lodge Campsite in order to complete the event. If all the proper ingredients were added, the sky would turn red and a special visual effect would play with ghosts shooting out of the cauldron to form a red skull in the sky. This could be done on either singleplayer or multiplayer, on any difficulty (including custom difficulties of any multiplier, even 0x), and there was no need to find the ghost type. After completing this event, the player would receive a Halloween '23 Badge (for the ID Card) and Trophy. This event was introduced in 0.9.1.0 and lasted until 0.9.2.0. ===Holiday 2023=== An event was introduced for Holiday 2023. During this event, 7 small maps would feature a Snowman Sticker while Sunny Meadows had a Snowball Gun Sticker on the map selection board. To complete the event, the player needed to do the following: *Find 3 mysterious parts on Sunny Meadows Once all parts were collected, a laughing sound would play, indicating that the objective has been completed, which would add a newly built device in the truck. *Using a snowball gun, destroy all the dancing snowmen on the 7 maps featuring a Snowman Sticker Each time all the snowmen in a map were destroyed, the weather changed to Snow, and the ghost changed its model and initiated a hunt. After destroying the snowmen on all maps, the player would receive a Holiday '23 Badge (for the ID Card) and Trophy. This event could be done on either singleplayer or multiplayer, on any difficulty (including custom difficulties of any multiplier, even 0x), and there was no need to find the ghost type. This event was introduced in 0.9.3.0 and lasted until 0.9.4.0. ==2024== ===Easter 2024=== An event was introduced for Easter 2024. During this event, 5 maps would feature a Nest Sticker while Camp Woodwind had a Forest Spirit Sticker on the map selection board. To complete the event, the player needed to do the following: *Capture a photo of the Forest Spirit's minion on the 5 maps featuring a Nest Sticker **The Forest Spirit's minion can be found using the UV Light and the D.O.T.S. Projector *After taking a photo of all 5 minions, capture a photo of the ghost on Camp Woodwind and successfully identify it After completing these objectives, the player would receive an Easter '24 Badge (for the ID Card) and Trophy. The tree in the lobby would also display a glowing visual effect while the event was ongoing. This event could be done on either singleplayer or multiplayer, on any difficulty (including custom difficulties of any multiplier, even 0x), and there was no need to find the ghost type when doing the minions' part. This event was introduced in 0.9.6.0 and lasted until 0.9.6.1. ===Halloween 2024=== The Crimson Eye event was introduced for Halloween 2024. In this event, the players were tasked to work together to achieve three community goals in order to get new ID cards, a trophy, and to permanently unlock the Blood Moon weather type. The three community goals were: *Identify ghosts correctly (10 Blood Moon points per ghost) *Complete optional objectives (2 Blood Moon points per objective) *Photograph any Totems you find (1 Blood Moon point per totem) When completing these goals on one of the four maps featuring the Blood Moon weather type (13 Willow Street, 42 Edgefield Road, Grafton Farmhouse, and Point Hope), players would add progression to a stage. Initially, the required Blood Moon points to complete each stage were 1 billion (stage 1), 1.5 billions (stage 2), and 2 billions (stage 3), but it was lowered twice: to 30 millions (stage 1), 40 millions (stage 2), and 50 millions (stage 3) on 30 October, and the requirement for the third stage was further reduced to 40 millions on 11 November. Once a stage was complete, players would start making progress in the next stage, and they needed to interact with the Blood Altar in the lobby to get a reward. The rewards for each stage were: *Stage 1: Summoner ID card *Stage 2: Upgraded Summoner ID card *Stage 3: Blood Moon Trophy and Blood Moon weather post event This event was introduced in 0.11.0 and lasted until 17 November 2024. It was originally planned to last until 13 November, but it was prolonged twice, on 11 November until 15 November, and again on 15 November after the event already ended, to ensure most players would get a chance to claim the rewards of the last stage. Kinetic Games shared the total amount of Blood Moon points collected and a leaderboard with the top 10 contributors on 15 November. 118,494,255 Blood Moon points were acquired by the whole playerbase with the top contributor contributing 13,104 points. ===Holiday 2024=== The Winter's Jest event was introduced for Holiday 2024. Similar to the Blood Moon event, players were tasked to work together to achieve a set of shared goals in order to receive rewards. However, for this event, there were some improvements, such as the introduction of personal daily and weekly tasks for the event, and improved scoring and rewards. The shared goals were: *Identify ghosts correctly (10 points per ghost with 1 additional point per difficulty multiplier) *Complete optional objectives (3 points per objective) *Open jack-in-the-boxes (2 points per box) When completing these goals on one of the four maps featuring festive decorations (Bleasdale Farmhouse, 6 Tanglewood Drive, Maple Lodge Campsite, and Point Hope), players would add progression to a stage. Once a stage of the overall community goal was completed, players were able to interact with the Event Altar to claim the stage's rewards. The rewards for each stage were: *Stage 1: Winter's Patron ID card *Stage 2: Upgraded Winter's Patron ID card *Stage 3: Winter's Jest Trophy This event was introduced in 0.11.1.0 and lasted until 31 December 2024. ==2025== ===Easter 2025=== The Cursed Hollow event was introduced for Easter 2025. Similar to the Blood Moon and Winter's Jest events, players could achieve a set of community goals. This event also introduced personal goals and daily map rotations. On maps featuring the event, which have Heavy Rain as default weather, players had to do the following to add progress to the community/personal goal: *Identify ghosts correctly (10 points per ghost with 1 additional point per difficulty multiplier) *Complete optional objectives (3 points per objective) *Find and reveal any forest minions (2 points per forest minion) Forest minions were revealed by shining a D.O.T.S. Projector at them, and they affected gameplay in one of several ways: *If the forest minion runs away, the player gains 5% sanity and the ghost's speed is decreased by 5%. This speed decrease does not stack and remains until the end of the contract. *If the forest minion jumps towards the player, the player loses 10% sanity and drops the item they are currently holding. *If the forest minion turns golden, a hunt is triggered (unless blocked by incense or the hunt cooldown). If this happens when the ghost is already hunting, the hunt will end immediately. Once a goal was completed, players would automatically receive the rewards upon login during the event window. The rewards for each goal were: *Community Goal 1: Hero of the Hollow ID Card *Community Goal 2: Upgradable Event Trophy *Personal Goal 1: Upgraded Hero of the Hollow ID Card *Personal Goal 2: Trophy Upgrade I *Personal Goal 3: Trophy Upgrade II *Personal Goal 4: Trophy Upgrade III A total of 3,600 event points was required to complete all 4 personal goals. The upgraded ID card is obtained after collecting 300 points, then 800 more points were required for the first trophy upgrade, 1,000 more points for the second, and 1,500 more points for the last one. This event was introduced in 0.12.1.0 and lasted until 8 May 2025. ===Halloween 2025=== The Crimson Eye event was brought back for Halloween 2025. It was similar to the Halloween 2024 event with minor adjustments. Players could add progress to the community/personal goal simply by playing contracts with Blood Moon weather: *Identify ghosts correctly (10 points per ghost with 1 additional point per difficulty multiplier) *Complete optional objectives (3 points per objective) *Interact with any Totems you find (2 points per totem) Contracts with a difficulty multiplier below 1x would reward no points. Each day, a group of 4 maps among the following guaranteed Blood Moon weather: 6 Tanglewood Drive, Camp Woodwind, Grafton Farmhouse, Bleasdale Farmhouse, Point Hope, 42 Edgefield Road, and 13 Willow Street. Once a goal was completed, players would automatically receive the rewards upon login during the event window. The rewards for each goal were: *Community Goal 1: Child of the Cult ID Card *Community Goal 2: Upgradable Crimson Eye Trophy *Personal Goal 1: Animated Child of the Cult ID Card *Personal Goal 2: Trophy Upgrade I *Personal Goal 3: Trophy Upgrade II *Personal Goal 4: Trophy Upgrade III A total of 3,600 event points was required to complete all 4 personal goals. The upgraded ID card is obtained after collecting 300 points, then 800 more points were required for the first trophy upgrade, 1,000 more points for the second, and 1,500 more points for the last one. This event was introduced in 0.14.2.0 and lasted until 1 November 2025. It was originally planned to last until 31 October. ===Holiday 2025=== The Winter's Jest event was brought back for Holiday 2025. It was similar to the Holiday 2024 event with minor adjustments. Players could add progress to the community/personal goal by doing the following on event maps: *Identify ghosts correctly and survive (10 points per ghost with 1 additional point per difficulty multiplier) *Complete optional objectives (3 points per objective) *Open jack-in-the-boxes (2 points per box) *Drop items in Krampus' bag (10 points per completed list) Contracts with a difficulty multiplier below 1x would reward no points. When Krampus' list was completed, a small gift would also be rewarded, containing items that could only be used in that contract among either equipment of various tiers, cookies that restore sanity (working like the Tier 1 Sanity Medication), or the snowball gun from the Holiday 2023 event. However, if an incorrect item was dropped in the bag, the list could no longer be completed, the small gift would reward coal, and the ghost would become 15% faster during hunts. Each day, four maps were chosen to host the event among: 6 Tanglewood Drive, 10 Ridgeview Court, 13 Willow Street, 42 Edgefield Road, Camp Woodwind, Bleasdale Farmhouse, Grafton Farmhouse, Maple Lodge Campsite, Point Hope, and Nell's Diner. Once a goal was completed, players would automatically receive the rewards upon login during the event window. The rewards for each goal were: *Community Goal 1: Toy Soldier ID Card *Community Goal 2: Upgradable Winter's Jest Trophy *Personal Goal 1: Animated Toy Soldier ID Card *Personal Goal 2: Trophy Upgrade I *Personal Goal 3: Trophy Upgrade II *Personal Goal 4: Trophy Upgrade III A total of 3,600 event points was required to complete all 4 personal goals. The upgraded ID card is obtained after collecting 300 points, then 800 more points are required for the first trophy upgrade, 1,000 more points for the second, and 1,500 more points for the last one. This event was introduced in 0.15.1.0 and lasted until 6 January 2026. ==See also== *Contests and giveaways Category:Gameplay fr:Événements spéciaux Category:Events","title":"Special events","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Special_events"}
{"content":"Tarot cards are a cursed possession that can trigger various randomly chosen effects on both the player or the ghost. ==Mechanics== As a cursed possession, tarot cards have a 1 in 7 chance per contract of being chosen as the cursed possession to spawn on a default difficulty (except Insanity), with one specific spawn location per map. Tarot cards can be with an empty hand and one card can be at a time. Tarot cards can only be drawn while inside the investigation area. Each Tarot cards deck contains 10 randomly generated cards. There are 10 possible card types the player can draw, each having a unique effect on either the player or the ghost. After being used, each card will burn up and vanish in a uniquely-colored flame. Each card type has a different, independent chance of being drawn, so some card types can be drawn multiple times or not at all in a single deck. Once all ten cards have been used, no more will be given to the player for that contract. When the deck is used up, all future hunts will also be extended by 20 seconds, even if no <span style=\"color: #8400c3;\">Death</span> card was drawn prior. ===Cards List=== {| class=\"sortable fandom-table\" !Card !Title !Effect !Burn Color !Draw Chance |- | |The Tower |Doubles all potential ghost activity for 20 seconds. |<span style=\"color: #0080ee;\">Blue</span> |20% |- | |The Wheel of Fortune |If the card burns green, the player gains 25% sanity.

This does not prevent hunts or ghost events from initiating while the ghost is trapped. |<span style=\"color: #53e1e6;\">Cyan</span> |10% |- | |The Sun |Sets the player's sanity to 100%. |<span style=\"color: #ffd700;\">Yellow</span> |5% |- | |The Moon |Sets the player's sanity to 0%. |<span class=\"clr\" style=\"color: #cccccc;\">White</span> |5% |- | |The High Priestess |Revives a random dead player where they died. If no one is currently dead, it will revive the next player who dies.

Only <span style=\"color: #ba48e0;\">The Fool</span> version can be drawn. |N/A |1% |} ==Tips== *The player should not draw a card during a hunt, since all cards drawn during one have a 100% chance to be <span style=\"color: #ba48e0;\">The Fool</span>, essentially wasting the card. *Though tarot cards cannot be drawn outside of the investigation area, this can be bypassed by drawing a card and walking outside of an exit door during the card-pulling animation. Cards will still take effect. **While using this method, as long as no players are inside: drawing <span style=\"color: #f25277;\">The Devil</span> will do nothing, and drawing <span style=\"color: #8400c3;\">Death</span> will not trigger a hunt but will still extend the duration of later hunts. *Players should take a photo of the cards before using them, as once all of the cards are drawn, the deck will no longer be an item and no photo can be taken. *Trying to take a ghost photo after drawing <span style=\"color: #f25277;\">The Devil</span> can sometimes be tricky, since the card's burning animation needs to be completed before the player can drop the deck, so multiplayer coordination is a good solution to this. **This is more easily done if the ghost decides to perform a singing ghost event and doesn't spawn too close to the targeted player, as singing ghost events usually last around 10 - 15 seconds. ==Trivia== *On Steam, the Tarot Cards designs are also used for the game's Trading Cards, which can be purchased and sold on the Community Market. *Tarot Cards are the only cursed possession that is not guaranteed to cause a cursed hunt, as it is possible for the entire deck to not contain a single <span style=\"color: #8400c3;\">Death</span> (roughly 34.9% chance); this can prove to be detrimental if the player wants to cause a hunt to aid in completing objectives and/or identifying the ghost. *Though extremely unlikely (1/10,000,000,000 decks), it is theoretically possible to draw <span style=\"color: #8400c3;\">Death</span> 10 times in a row, making Tarot Cards the cursed possession that can cause the most cursed hunts, up to 10 cursed hunts if the player is extraordinarily (un)lucky. ==Gallery== <gallery> !Cards.png|Card deck back print Warped Souls - Background.jpg|Warped Souls Background for Steam Warped Souls - Profile.png|Warped Souls Profile for Steam </gallery> ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !0.5.0 |Added tarot cards. |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |0.5.2.0 |The Tower now affects D.O.T.S projectors, ghost writing books, and doors. |- |The High Priestess now revives the next player to die if no player is currently dead. |- !0.8.1.0 |The Tower now doubles all ghost activity for the next 20 seconds, instead of forcing an interaction to occur. |} ==Notes== Category:Item fr:Cartes de tarot ru:Карты Таро","title":"Tarot Cards","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Tarot_Cards"}
{"content":"The truck is the transportation and mobile base for investigators that is stocked with all the equipment required for the contract, and is also used to transport players between the lobby and the contract map. ==Mechanics== After a contract is started, players will spawn in the truck, followed by the equipment brought by the players for the contract. It also houses the computer, Objective Board, sanity monitor, the site map, sound monitor, site activity monitor and the setup timer. Once all players have loaded in, the back of the truck can be opened by with the keypad on the left side when facing the back from the inside, allowing players to walk to the investigation area. The Main Door Key to the investigation area spawns to the left of the keypad. When leaving, all living players must be on the truck for the doors and ramp to close. Dead players do not have to be on the truck for this to work. While the truck is still closing up, the keypad can be used again to reopen the doors, but only after the doors have begun to swing close. Equipment can be picked up from the wall rack, and placed back to the same slot using . Certain equipment such as motion sensors cannot be placed inside or around the truck. Video cameras and photo cameras will turn on automatically outside the truck, and turn off when inside the truck. The truck is also parked in the lobby. However, all the screens in the trailer (except the setup timer, which permanently shows 00:00) are turned off, and the Daily and Weekly Tasks clipboards are not present. ==Trivia== *The truck and the area around it are considered \"safe\"; the ghost cannot be in these areas, and there is no passive sanity drain. At the same time, it is still possible to effectively use some cursed possessions while in safe areas. For example, the Hanged Man tarot card can kill players even if they are in the truck. *The truck appears to be an Iveco Eurocargo 75E18, with a license plate of 7GHD666. GHD stands for Ghost Huntin' Distribution, the fictional name of the in-game company. 666 is often known as the Number of The Beast.

{"content":"Incense is a purchasable item that can be used to temporarily deter the ghost from hunting or blind the ghost during a hunt when ignited. ==Usage== To light incense, have an igniter in the inventory, hold the incense, then press the key. Incense thrown on the ground can also be lit by aiming at it while holding an igniter or firelight, then pressing . Once lit, the incense will emit smoke for a certain amount of time depending on the tier level: *Tier I: 5 seconds *Tier II: 6 seconds *Tier III: 7 seconds While burning, the incense attempts multiple times per second to successfully apply its effect(s), but can only apply the effect(s) once. When the incense is used up, the smoke will stop being emitted and the model will finish burning to a stub. There is no explicit indication of whether the incense was used effectively or not. Used incense can still be handheld, but since there's nothing to use, it is normally discarded. ===Effects=== The incense has a range in which the ghost must be for its effects to be successfully applied. This range depends on the tier level: *Tier I: 3 metres *Tier II: 4 metres *Tier III: 5 metres ====Regular \"cleansing\"==== When the ghost is within the incense's range while it is burning, the following will occur: *Ghost activity will be increased marginally *The ghost will be unable to initiate a hunt on its own for a certain duration: **Demon: 60 seconds **Spirit: 180 seconds **All other ghosts: 90 seconds *If the ghost is a Gallu, it will switch to its \"enraged\" state if it was in a \"normal\" state, or to its \"normal\" state if it was in a \"weakened\" state. *If the ghost is a Yurei, it will also return to its favorite room and cannot roam out for 90 seconds. This will not prevent ghost events from happening outside the room. Lighting incense will not prevent cursed hunts nor stop an already ongoing hunt, but doing this during a hunt will prevent further attempts to initiate regular hunts for the specified duration starting from when the incense effect is applied. If another incense is used while this effect from a previous incense is ongoing, this effect <u>will not</u> be re-applied and the timer <u>will not</u> be reset. Due to a quirk in how incense works, ghosts which are standing on stairs will not be affected by the \"cleansing\" property of incense, though they will be affected by the \"blinding\" ability described below. ====Blinding during hunts==== <div class=\"mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"width: 200px; float: right;\"> <span style=\"color:#ffcd36; font-size:80%\">This image has flashing lights.</span> <div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\"></div> </div> Incense can be used to \"blind\" the ghost during a hunt. For this effect to apply, the ghost must be within the incense's range. When the effect is successfully applied, the ghost will: *Be forced into its \"wandering phase\", walking in a random direction *Be unable to detect or kill players; one can walk through it without dying *Temporarily lose its accumulated speed from line-of-sight *The Tier II incense additionally slows the ghost down to 50% of its speed. *The Tier III incense additionally stops the ghost from moving entirely. This effect lasts for 5 seconds for most ghosts, 4 seconds for an enraged Gallu, 6 seconds for a weakened Gallu, and 7.5 seconds for a Moroi. After this period, the ghost will return to its regular hunting behaviour, and be able to see and kill players again. Multiple incenses can be used for the same purpose during the same hunt with no diminishing returns, to blind the ghost for up to 20 seconds (30 for a Moroi) consecutively. If another incense is used while this effect from a previous incense is ongoing, this effect will be re-applied and the timer will be reset. ==Tips== *When lighting incense near a ghost during a hunt, the ghost may coincidentally take the same path as a player, especially in tight hallways. It does not mean that the ghost can still see the player. If possible, light the incense near (but not in) a hiding spot, so that you can reach it before the ghost is no longer blind. *If you are not the host, and especially if there is some latency between you and the server, the game may register the ghost killing the player before the incense effect actually applies. To avoid this, try lighting the incense earlier. *In some scenarios, it may be beneficial to use a lower-tier incense, for example if the ghost detects a player in a hiding spot and corners them, and an incense is used to protect the player; using a Tier III incense will freeze the ghost in place, possibly in a location where they can still see the player in the hiding spot and force them to switch to another hiding spot, while a Tier I or Tier II incense will cause the ghost to move away and allow the player to stay in said hiding spot. Using a lower-tier incense is also beneficial if the ghost is significantly faster than the player e.g. against a naturally fast ghost such as a young Thaye, or in custom difficulties where the ghost is faster and/or the player is slower; a Tier I incense will allow the ghost to stay relatively fast while blind, potentially moving the ghost much further away and putting a much larger distance between the player and the ghost compared to a Tier II or Tier III incense. ==Gallery== <gallery> Smudge sticks.png|Pre-Exposition model being held in the player's hand. </gallery> ==Objectives== {| class=\"article-table\" !Objective !Actual requirements |- |Cleanse the area near the ghost using Incense |Light Incense within range of the ghost |- |Repel the Ghost with Incense while it's chasing someone |Smudge a hunting ghost while it has line-of-sight with a player, making it wander |} ==Trivia== *Before 0.9.0, Incense was referred to as \"Smudge Sticks\". Despite being referred to as \"smudging\", the smudge sticks are used more akin to \"smoke cleansing\". Smudging is a spiritual and religious practice found in various Native American cultures, many of which use white sage, a plant native to North America. Smudging is typically used for personal spiritual cleansing, prayer, and ceremonial occasions, the technique varying from tribe to tribe. Smoke cleansing, on the other hand, is used predominantly to ward off negative energy and evil spirits, and is used by wafting the smoke of sage or herbs around an area, sometimes accompanied by prayer, chanting, or incantations. Smoke cleansing is a practice commonly found in modern-day Wicca and witchcraft. *The original description for this item was as follows: \"This has always been one of the main ways to weaken the more common ghosts.

{"content":"The sound recorder is a device used to record sound evidence. ==Mechanics== The Sound Recorder can be on to begin scanning the area for any noise disturbance produced by the ghost. When it detects a valid noise, its sound meter will start to rise, indicating to the player how close they are to the source of the sound. To record a sound, the player must hold the button to start recording and get sufficiently close to the source (indicated by the meter lights turning green on Tier I, the graph going above the bar on Tier II, and the circle at the center of the radar turning solid on Tier III). The recording will stop automatically once a valid sound is captured. Up to 3 audio clips can be stored in the journal per contract. The recorder picks up ghost-related sounds such as whispers or ghost events, as well as evidence-related sounds such as Spirit Box responses, Ghost Writing, or EMF Level 5. The quality of the recording depends on the proximity to the sound and the tier of the recorder. The Tier III Sound Recorder has directional audio and visual indicators that can be helpful in locating the source of the sound. ===Ghost-related mechanics=== *The Banshee has a 33% chance to produce one of its unique shrieks instead of a regular paranormal sound. *The Moroi can curse a player who successfully records a sound. *The Myling produces paranormal sounds on the sound recorder more frequently. ==Tips== *Sound Recorders (especially the Tier III) can be used to locate the ghost by following the sound levels it picks up, much like the EMF reader with EMF signatures. Due to their relatively short range however, they are best used on smaller maps. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !0.13.0 |Added the Sound Recorder. |- !0.13.1.0 |An audio and visual cue will now signify the completion of recording Sounds. |}<br> Category:Equipment fr:Enregistreur de Son","title":"Sound Recorder","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Sound_Recorder"}
{"content":"The Sound Sensor is a piece of Equipment in Phasmophobia. It detects sounds in a large area around it, allowing the player to track potential ghost activity in combination with the Sound Monitor. ==Usage== A sound sensor can be on the ground or other flat surface. The detection area is highlighted as an orange circle on the Site Map in the truck. The sound sensor picks up most noises, except for players talking through local and global chat. Any noise picked up by a sensor will appear as a bar on the Sound Monitor, showing how loud the sound was and identifying which sensor picked up the sound. The screen will display the total volume of all sounds detected. The value displayed will update every second. <!--0.1 dB picked up on a Parabolic Microphone is equivalent to 1% on the Sound Monitor. --> By default, the sound sensor picks up sound in a 5-meter radius on the same floor, ignoring walls. This radius can be increased by clicking on the enlargement icon on the Sound Monitor in the truck. The sound sensor can also be muted by clicking on the speaker icon. The Tier III Sound Sensor has two additional modes which can be switched to by with it while it is placed, or directly while in hand. These modes can't be switched from the truck. ==Tips== *A Sound Sensor can be used to monitor Ghost Writing evidence as the Ghost Writing Book produces a distinctive scribbling sound when the ghost writes in it. *Placing sound sensors in a central area of several rooms is a good way to cover a lot of ground when looking for the ghost's location early on. ==Trivia== *Sound sensors detect the noise of the Haunted Mirror if it is in their range. *Some equipment are not picked up by the sound sensor such as the EMF Reader and the Spirit Box. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access Alpha |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |24 March 2020<br>(Part 2) |Added a preview outline when placing a sound sensor. |- |More sounds can now be detected. |- !19 June 2020 |Sound sensors are now level-locked. |- !27 June 2020 |Sound sensors are now unlocked at level 7. |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |13 August 2020 |Sound sensors can now be picked up after being placed. |- |Increased the cost from $60 to $80. |- !16 August 2020(Part 2) |Sound sensors now detect doors being shut. |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !0.4.0 |Sound sensors can now be placed on the floor. |- ! rowspan=\"5\" |0.6.0 |Changed the sound sensor model. |- |The range covered is now a spherical radius instead of a cube. |- |Placement now matches that of other equipment such as candles and video cameras. |- |Sounds on sound monitor in the van are now more accurately displayed. |- |Players talking or using the walkie-talkie (global chat) are no longer picked up. |- !0.7.0 |Sound sensors now show room name of the room it is physically in, instead of the room the player was standing in when they placed it. |- !0.9.0 |The Sound Sensor now has 3 tiers. |- !0.9.5.0 |You can now rotate the Sound Sensor III whilst placing it. |- !0.10.0 |Sound sensors can now be muted from the truck. |}<br> Category:Equipment fr:Capteur sonore ru:Датчик звука","title":"Sound Sensor","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Sound_Sensor"}
{"content":"Training is a tutorial mission available in Phasmophobia, designed to help new players learn the essential aspects of the investigation process. It provides a basic overview of most in-game mechanics, including hunts and how to utilize evidence-based equipment to gather evidence. The Training mission uses a specially-built location simply called \"Warehouse\", which consists of a series of rooms that are divided into several stages for each lesson. On a technical level, there is not an actual active \"ghost\" in Training, and instead aspects of its behavior are emulated via scripted triggers. Tutorials are given by both text written on white boards and vocal instructions from the man over the radio used in many other parts of the game, and inform the player to complete a certain task to progress further in the tutorial. On most whiteboards, a series of colored post-it notes will list out the control scheme. It is possible to back-track to already-completed sections for review purposes. Once the mission is completed, the player goes back to the truck and returns to the main lobby. The Journal is accessible during training, but as there are no rewards, it is pointless to try to select the ghost type. == Structure == <br /> The Warehouse is a special small map created for Training, and is not otherwise playable. It is a linear series of rooms made up of raised drywall, plywood, planks, and doors located within a dark, spartan warehouse made of primarily concrete. There are no exit doors, though some sections will remain locked until their objectives are completed. The Warehouse is a winding, linear experience leading the player through a step-by-step lesson of the basic mechanics of the game. The training is divided in several \"stages\" separated by locked doors, in which the player must perform a specific action in order to proceed to the next one. There are a total of 11 stages, each introducing the player to a specific element of gameplay, including all evidence types. == Stages == === Stage 1: Essentials === The player gets an overview of the most basic mechanics: taking a Flashlight from the Truck, pressing the keypad to open the Truck's back door and lower the ramp, acquiring the Key, and opening doors to progress though a line of rooms, simply labeled Rooms One through Three. A \"ghost\" will occasionally throw items in Room Three as the player passes through. Although the player is told to take a Flashlight and the key to continue, they are technically optional, and the player can progress onwards without them. === Stage 2: Sanity === The player is introduced to the mechanic of Sanity and how to restore it. This stage features tier 1 Sanity Medication the player must drink in order to progress to the next stage. === Stage 3: Lights === The player is introduced to the mechanics related to lights, such as passive sanity drain and the fuse box. This room contains three light switches which each control one light. Turning all lights on will trip the fuse box and allow the player to proceed to the next stage. === Stage 4: EMF === The player is introduced to the EMF evidence. The player is offered a tier 1 EMF Reader and invited into a room with several items placed on tables. Eventually, an invisible force will throw the items around the room, creating EMF readings. The player must find an EMF 5 reading with the reader to proceed to the next stage. === Stage 5: Ultraviolet === The player is introduced to the Ultraviolet evidence. The player is provided with a tier 1 UV Light which they must use to reveal a handprint on the door and a footprint around the room leading to the next stage. === Stage 6: Freezing Temperatures === The player is introduced to the Freezing Temperatures evidence. Provided with a tier 1 Thermometer, the player must search several rooms and find which one has below-freezing temperatures to proceed to the next stage. === Stage 7: D.O.T.S Projector === The player is introduced to the D.O.T.S evidence. Provided with a tier 1 D.O.T.S Projector, the player must enter a dark room and reveal a group of ghost dummies with it to proceed to the next stage. === Stage 8: Ghost Orbs === The player is introduced to the Ghost Orbs evidence. Provided with a tier 1 Video Camera, the player has to search a dark room for Ghost Orbs. The stage completes after staring at the orb for 2 seconds while being near it. === Stage 9: Ghost Writing === The player is introduced to the Ghost Writing evidence. The player must place a tier 1 Ghost Writing Book in a neighboring room and wait for it to be signed in order to proceed to the next stage. === Stage 10: Spirit Box === The player is introduced to the Spirit Box evidence. Using a tier 1 Spirit Box, the player must attempt to obtain an answer to proceed to the next stage. The \"ghost\" will sometimes be in a neighboring room with a light that must be turned off in order to obtain an answer. === Stage 11: Hunts === The player is introduced to hunts and the Setup Timer. In this stage, the player must enter a room featuring several lockers and hiding spots where they will be confronted with the simulation of a hunt. When the player enters the room, all doors will lock and hunt effects (such as lights and electronics flickering) will occur. Only when the player has entered a hiding spot and turned off their electronics, a ghost will appear at the entry door and cross the room before disappearing. If the player is spotted by the ghost, they will be teleported back to the beginning of the stage. The stage concludes once the player remains hidden until the ghost disappears. == Trivia == *Internally, the Warehouse map is referred to as \"TrainingV2\". *The Truck at the end of Training is actually a separate vehicle, and not the same one the player started from. This can be easily noticed, as this separate Truck will not have any flashlights in it. *The \"ghost\" in Training provides six types of evidence: EMF Level 5, Ultraviolet, Freezing Temperatures, Ghost Orbs, Ghost Writing, and Spirit Box, which does not indicate an actual ghost that is in the game as ghosts only have three evidence types associated with them. *Prior to the Ascension update, the Training mission consisted of 6 Tanglewood Drive with a random ghost that could give evidence but could not hunt, similar to the \"Friendly Ghost\" custom difficulty option. It came with tips on the TV screen located in the Living Room that explained what each equipment did. As with the current iteration of Training, no rewards were given at the end of the mission. **Additionally, as this was a \"regular\" level, and before the Ouija Board became a cursed possession in 0.5.0, it could occasionally spawn in the map. This still could not get the ghost to hunt, as the Ouija Board could not break and trigger a cursed hunt during that time. *It is possible that the current Training mission—or at least the Warehouse map that it takes place in—was intended to be accessible from multiplayer lobbies by teams up to four players at once, however as of 0.9.0 the mission is only accessible from the main menu and can only be played by a single player. *In the early years of alpha, training was available as a lobby mission for co-op (probably to test out chat features, etc.); this has since been removed. == History == {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" | Early Access |- ! rowspan=\"2\"| 0.9.0 | Changed the training map to be a Warehouse instead of 6 Tanglewood Drive. |- | The training now shows the player how to use each evidence equipments, and gives tips and tricks on how to play the game in a controlled environment. |- ! rowspan=\"4\"|0.10.0 |Lowered the temperature of the training to make it easier to get Freezing Temperatures. |- |Reduced the amount of equipment to one in each room. |- |The player will now have to get EMF Level 5 to get past the EMF room. |- |Replaced the glowstick with the UV flashlight as of the tier change. |} Category:Gameplay fr:Entraînement","title":"Training","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Training"}

{"content":"The summoning circle is a cursed possession that is used to summon the ghost. This can be used to get a ghost photo, as well as facilitate the completion of several Objectives. ==Mechanics== As a cursed possession, the summoning circle has a 1 in 7 chance of being the chosen item that will spawn on a map on preset difficulties, with one spawn location per map. ===Usage=== The summoning circle can be used by lighting all five red candles by aiming at them and by pressing the button with a lit igniter or a lit firelight. Each lit candle deducts 16% sanity from nearby players. Contrary to other fire sources, ghosts cannot light these candles up. Summoning circle candles can be blown out by the ghost, in the same way as regular firelights. However, they cannot self-extinguish except when lit while the player has less than 16% sanity. Relighting an extinguished candle will drain 16% sanity again for nearby players. Once all five candles are lit, the ghost is summoned and fully materialized, except a Shade, which has a chance of appearing as a transparent shadow. The summoned ghost stays motionless for 5 seconds, unable to kill players. This stationary period is considered a ghost event. However, the front door will lock immediately after lighting the last candle. After this event, the lights in the summoning circle's room will turn off and the ghost will immediately initiate a cursed hunt on the spot, without an additional 1-second grace period. Once the summoning circle is activated, it cannot be used again. If a candle is lit while below 16% individual sanity, there are two possibilities that might occur: *If it is not the last candle, the candle will extinguish itself after a short delay.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"a\" /> *If it is the last candle, there will be no \"ghost event\" period, and the cursed hunt will immediately begin after a 1-second grace period. If the last candle is lit while a hunt is ongoing, the ghost will instead be teleported to the centre of the circle, possibly killing players on the spot; this does not reset the current hunt's timer, but will extend all future hunts as usual.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"b\" /> ===Rewards=== Taking a photo of a summoning circle, used or not, will yield a photo labelled as Summoning Circle, and reward up to $7 and 7 XP, depending on the tier of the Photo Camera. ==Tips== *Using a Tier 3 crucifix in range of the Summoning Circle will prevent the cursed hunt triggered after summoning the ghost, virtually removing the risk of the Circle, though the massive sanity cost for using the Circle (16% per candle for a total of 80%) still poses a problem. *To prevent a hunt starting before the ghost can be summoned, use incense or place crucifixes near the ghost just before lighting the circle. *Where needed, most Optional Objectives can be completed directly or indirectly using the Summoning Circle. **As such, it is best saved for after the ghost has been identified to quickly complete them. ==Trivia== *Before 0.9.3.0, the border of the Summoning Circle used to repeat the English words \"sacrifice your sanity\" transliterated into a runic alphabet. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !0.5.0 |Added summoning circle. |- !0.5.0.2 |Summoning circles now deduct 16% sanity per candle instead of 20% for when the ghost materialises. |- !0.7.0 |The ghost will now hunt instantly if the player has less than 16% sanity when lighting the last candle. |- !0.8.1.0 |Lighting a Summoning Circle candle with no sanity will now extinguish it instantly.<br>Note: Lighting the 5th candle with no sanity will cause an instant hunt. |- !0.9.3.0 |Updated the textures, audio, and effects for the Summoning Circle |} ==Notes== Category:Item fr:Cercle d'invocation ru:Круг призыва","title":"Summoning Circle","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Summoning_Circle"}
{"content":"Sunny Meadows Mental Institution (or simply Sunny Meadows) is a map in Phasmophobia and the largest by number of rooms, succeeding the original Asylum map. It is a two-story decrepit psychiatric hospital that can either be played as a whole map or separated into five Restricted areas, one of which is randomly selected for the contract. ==Description== Sunny Meadows seems to once have been a Catholic parish/asylum as it features an old chapel and has several nods to it having once been a religious institution. Unlike most other maps, the building seems to be completely abandoned, and even somewhat in a hurry (for example, most of the \"surgical\" equipment in the morgue is still in place, as are some decaying corpses and human body parts). It is unclear what exactly made the asylum shut down and how long ago it happened. It is a run-down, cluttered environment, with every footstep reverberating through the halls. Take note of the ghost's scratching along the walls, and beware its wrath -- you may find yourself separated from your fellow investigators during a hunt as the wings' doors lock shut. While the derelict stone environment and profane Chapel are eerie enough, the true horrors lie within the location's bowels: blood-stained walls, rotting corpses, and piles of gore provide ample indication of the atrocities performed within. The screams of the poor souls tortured and slain within its dark confines can still be heard through the quiet blackness. ==Structure== Sunny Meadows contains 69 rooms, split into 5 wings and across 2 floors, as well as an outdoor courtyard. The wings are: *Courtyard Wing: Built around a large courtyard, this wing contains amenities for patients and visitors as well as staff facilities. *Male Wing: This wing contains several bedrooms, a dormitory, a common bathroom, as well as a day room for the male patients of the institution. *Female Wing: This wing contains several bedrooms, a dormitory, a common bathroom, as well as a day room for the female patients of the institution. *Hospital Wing: This wing contains several common hospital rooms as well as an operating room and a macabre morgue, still reeking with the remains of its past residents. *Restricted Wing: This wing was presumably where the most aggressive or unfortunate patients received their \"treatments\" under the form of brutal torture, containing several cells filled with blood and gore. ===Layout tips=== *A labeled map, albeit one that is weathered and altogether difficult to read, is provided in the Entrance Corridor. **The room names Servant Room 1 and Servant Room 2 are swapped on this map from what is actually defined in-game. *Certain rooms contain old bell-type alarm clocks and metronomes which the ghost might interact with. *The crosses found hanging on the walls in various parts of the building can be turned upside down by the ghost, which will emit a loud scratching sound. Finding a cross that has been turned upside down (except for the ones in the Chapel) is a strong sign that the ghost is nearby. Crosses cannot be flipped back upright once they have been interacted with. *In general, the main hallways are littered with props and obstructions; running in a straight line without bumping into something is generally not feasible. *The ghost cannot perform a ghost event on players that are standing in the following rooms: **Basement west corridor **Restricted area (the corridor, not the individual rooms) **Courtyard corridor **Female wing (the corridor, not the individual rooms) **Male wing (the corridor, not the individual rooms) *The favourite room cannot be any of the corridors and stairwells, barring the entrance corridor next to the chapel; either of the padded rooms; and the Foyer on the large version of the map (the Foyer can be the favourite room on the Restricted version, however). *There is currently a bug where if the ghost is in the Entrance Corridor, the Ouija Board might respond with its current location as Bake House instead. *The following rooms count as dark rooms and hence will drain sanity with 80 % of the rate, even with all room lights being on: **Connecting corridor, courtyard corridor, right entrance stairwell, left entrance stairwell, classroom, kitchen, male wing (hallway), female wing (hallway), hospital wing (hallway), basement west corridor, basement corridor, basement east corridor, restricted area (hallway), morgue, west stairwell and east stairwell *The chapel, courtyard, male room 5 and restricted room 2 have no main room lights and hence no means of sanity drain prevention (other than firelights). See Third-party tools for a list of detailed map viewers that players may use. ===Key hiding spots and strategies=== *When a Hunt begins, the door to each wing will lock, forcing hunters to work with the area of the map that they find themselves in as the hunt begins, potentially separating players from one-another. As such, it is wise to check for hiding spots both near where investigation is taking place and in wings on the route to the favourite room, as running to known hiding spots may not be possible. Beware, the ghost can still pass through these doors during a hunt. *When running away from a ghost, make good use of the various props such as dividers and cabinets cluttering the hallways in order to repeatedly break line of sight and reach a hiding spot or even throw it off, as more often than not the hiding spots are located at the ends and beginnings of hallways. There are 28 \"sanctioned\" hiding spots in Sunny Meadows: *Manager's Office, behind a cupboard *Infirmary, lockers *Male Room 1, behind an upright standing bed (only if the bed is not against the back wall) *Male Wing, behind a gurney and a tilted shelf near door to Courtyard Corridor *Male Wing, behind a gurney and a tilted shelf in front of Male Room 5 *Male Wing, behind a bookshelf near Male Dorm Room *Male Day Room, behind a shelf on the right *Male Dorm Room, behind a tilted bed and a tilted coffee table *West Visitors' Room, behind a shelf on the left *Classroom, behind a shelf (only when there are two shelves) *Servant Dining Room, behind a shelf (only when there are two shelves) *Boiler Room, behind multiple barrels *Servants' Room 2, behind a cupboard *Utility Room, behind the racks at the far end (only when cardboard boxes are present) *Female Room 4, behind a bed (when not against the left wall) *Female Wing, behind a gurney near door to East Stairwell *Female Wing, behind a gurney next to Female Dorm Room *Female Day Room, behind a shelf on the left of the piano *Female Dorm Room, behind a tilted bed and a tilted coffee table *Basement Corridor, behind a bookshelf near the possible fuse box location *Matron Office, behind a cupboard *Basement Storage, behind multiple privacy screens in a U-shape *Hospital Room 2, behind the bed (only if the privacy screen between bed and right wall is not present) *Operating Room, behind a privacy screen *Morgue, lockers *Morgue, behind a cart with trash bags with flies around it *Basement East Corridor, behind multiple privacy screens near door to Restricted Area *Restricted Area, behind multiple privacy screens in a U-shape next to Restricted Room 3 Depending on the difficulty, some of these hiding spots may be blocked by the presence of bulky items or their concealing elements removed: *Amateur: None *Intermediate: 2 *Professional: 3 *Nightmare/Insanity: 5 *3-player game: +1 available hiding spot *4-player game: +2 available hiding spots <small>Additional hiding spots on multiplayer is overridden when \"Number of hiding places\" is set to None</small> ==Sunny Meadows Mental Institution - Restricted== The restricted version of the map can be selected independently of the main location, and is considered a medium map. In the Restricted version, only the immediate entrance area (including the Chapel where the Cursed possessions spawn) and one randomly-selected wing of the building will be able to be accessed, with the entrances to the others being blocked off. ===Layout tips=== *Contrary to the map's Large version, the Foyer in Sunny Meadows Restricted can be chosen as the favourite room. ===Key hiding spots and strategies=== There are 6 \"sanctioned\" hiding spots in this variation of Sunny Meadows Restricted: *Manager's Office, behind a cupboard *Infirmary, lockers *West Visitors' Room, behind a shelf on the left *Classroom, behind a shelf (only when there are two shelves) *Servants' Room 2, behind a cupboard *Utility Room, behind the racks at the far end (only when cardboard boxes are present) Depending on the difficulty, some of these hiding spots may be blocked by the presence of bulky items or their concealing elements removed: *Amateur: None *Intermediate: 2 *Professional: 3 *Nightmare/Insanity: 5 *3-player game: +1 available hiding spot *4-player game: +2 available hiding spots <small>Additional hiding spots on multiplayer is overridden when \"Number of hiding places\" is set to None</small> -

Due to the large size of the map when playing the regular variant, it is usually best left to chance for players to find the bone, or to make use of the Ouija Board if it spawns, instead of attempting to search every room for it. However, finding the bone on the Restricted variant without paranormal assistance is feasible, due to the smaller search area. As of version 0.14.0, due to a bug, the bone always spawns at the western edge of the Entrance Corridor, just to the left of the door to the Courtyard Corridor. ==Cursed possession locations== All the cursed possessions are located in the Chapel: the Monkey Paw at the foot of the large crucifix, and five other possessions arranged around the Summoning Circle in the middle. ==Fuse box locations== There are 5 locations where the fuse box can spawn: *In the foyer on the left wall *In the utility, the first room to the right that can be entered after the chapel *In the courtyard on the wall separating the chapel *In the boiler house *In the basement corridor next to the stairwell exit ==Apocalypse Challenge== The Apocalypse Challenge can only be completed in Sunny Meadows. This is indicated with a golden skull on the map polaroid of the map selection board when in Singleplayer. ==Trivia== *A number of tags each listing a possible wish for the Monkey Paw can be found in various rooms. *Ghosts can blow out some of the lit candles that are found in the Chapel. This may even result in an early Onryo hunt. *Despite being classified as a large map, Sunny Meadows is actually smaller than both Prison and Brownstone High School—both originally Medium maps—by floor area within the map (investigation area). *One can light brought-in firelights without an igniter by throwing them against the Chapel candles. By extension, the summoning circle can also be lit without an igniter. Tier III firelights are best suited for this, as they will never extinguish by themselves or by throwing them. *Sunny Meadows Restricted was originally a Small map, and was changed to Medium in 0.10.0, making it the second map to change size classes across versions of the game. *Female Day Room, Male Day Room, as well as West Visitors' Room each have a standing lamp that needs to be turned on in addition to the main room lights for full sanity drain prevention. *The stairs in Right Entrance Stairwell look to lead to a possible upper floor, however they are blocked up. ==Easter eggs== *The map contains various elements which seems to be telling the story of one of the ghost models, semi-officially named Patient 07. **In 0.6.0.1, the \"pajama girl\" ghost model was changed to wear white gowns with a barcode and a label saying \"Patient 07\". In the same update, on the former Asylum map, one of the patient rooms had tally marks counting up to 1080 on its walls which could be revealed using a UV flashlight or Glowstick, as well as the following writing:<br><br>I have to leave<br>Somewhere new<br>I don't belong here<br>I'll go soon<br>To get better, I hope<br>I found a new home<br>Sunny Meadows<br>Sounds nice, a place to heal<br><br> **In Padded Room 1 in the Hospital Wing, tally marks counting up to 7560 can be seen with a UV Flashlight or Glowstick, as well as bloody handprints covering the door. This suggests that it might have been Patient 07's room once she was transferred to Sunny Meadows, or at least was locked in there for a significant period of time (approximately 20.7 years if the marks are counted as days). **Finally, Patient 07's corpse can be found rotting in the Morgue. This means that Patient 07 died (most likely of poor treatment and brutal torture) in Sunny Meadows and that her tormented soul has since been condemned to haunt the world of the living. *If the player lights the Summoning Circle in Custom difficulty with at least six cursed possessions in the game, every lit candle will turn a crucifix in the room upside down. If the last candle is lit, the large cross in the Chapel will ignite. **The temperature of the ignited large cross is (the devil's number). **This easter egg is hinted at by many writings on the Chapel's walls. \"Six Becomes One\" is written multiple times both using Latin and runic alphabets. *A potato can be found in the Bake House, inside the 2nd oven from the left on the top row. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !0.7.0 |Added Sunny Meadows Mental Institution/Restricted. |- !0.7.1.0 |Added window-knocking sounds to windows. |- !0.7.1.2 |The boilers now have a burning loop sound. |- !0.7.1.4 |The ghost can no longer do ghost events in most hallways (basement west corridor, restricted area, courtyard corridor, female wing and male wing). |- !0.8.0 |Improved two hiding spots; one by the restricted area door and one in the restricted wing. |- !0.8.0.4 |Adjusted several hiding spots when they are blocked, moving and deleting props where necessary. |- ! rowspan=\"3\" |0.8.0.6 |Ghosts and players can now move the large metal trays. |- |Coal now has new sounds when dropped or thrown. |- |Many assorted improvements to prop and map collision, as well as ghost pathing. |- !0.10.0 |Sunny Meadows Restricted is now categorized as a medium location |}<br> Category:Maps Category:Large Map fr:Sunny Meadows Mental Institution ru:Sunny Meadows Mental Institution","title":"Sunny Meadows Mental Institution","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Sunny_Meadows_Mental_Institution"}

{"content":"The video camera is a piece of electronic Starter Equipment used to detect Ghost Orbs and to record videos. ==Mechanics== When a video camera is , the flip screen will open automatically. The video camera can be used handheld with its built-in display or on a flat surface or a tripod. The video camera will automatically start streaming its video feed to the computer when held outside the truck or placed. Holding the placement key will show a translucent preview of the video camera and its facing direction, which can be adjusted while holding the placement key by moving the mouse left and right. Be aware that even though certain spots are shown as valid, the camera may tip over or fall due to the geometry or other objects placed on the surface. When the ghost manifests during a ghost event or a hunt, it will cause interference on all nearby video cameras and distort the image on both the built-in display and the video feed. Cameras of higher Tier with a better image quality will be significantly less impacted by ghost interference, aiding players in observing or tracking the ghost during a ghost event or a hunt. Ghosts may occasionally knock over placed down video cameras within a certain range, forcing players to actively tend to them. Placing a camera on a tripod will reduce the probability of the ghost knocking it over. The stability provided by the tripod will depend on its Tier. Night vision can be while holding the active video camera or via the computer keyboard. When night vision is turned on, any Ghost Orbs present can be seen through the video camera. Holding the button while holding the active video camera will start a video recording. If a valid subject is captured, it will be recorded in the Media tab in the journal. Video recording can also be started from the computer in the truck by clicking on the Rec button. ==Tips== *The video camera's night vision function can be very useful when using a D.O.T.S Projector as the ghost's silhouette may be easier to see with night vision. *The video camera can also be used to maintain surveillance on areas such as hallways, rooms, and the fuse box. This can allow for easy viewing of certain stationary evidence like Fingerprints, Ghost Writing, EMF Level 5, salt, or D.O.T.S Projector. However, the video feed becomes extremely distorted whenever the ghost manifests during a Ghost Event or a hunt, making observation very difficult. **Note that if the camera isn't positioned properly and/or is of a lower tier which has worse quality, it can be difficult to spot Ghost Writing and read EMF Level 5 off the EMF Reader; Players should still go in personally and check evidence every now and then to prevent missing any. *It is recommended to turn your flashlight (and room lights) off while using night vision to check for Ghost Orbs, as it makes the camera feed extremely bright, making it nearly impossible to see through the camera to spot any Orbs. ==Gallery== <gallery> File:Ghost Orbs on the Go.jpg|A Tier II video camera being used handheld.

{"content":"The Site Activity Monitor is the fourth monitor on the wall of the Truck, which shows the current activity ranging from 0 to 10, roughly matching the readings of an EMF Reader. A low reading may indicate little to no recent activity, while a high reading may mean high levels of ghost activity. On Nightmare and Insanity difficulties, the Site Activity Monitor is damaged and gives random readings, causing it to be useless and preventing players from discerning ghost activity by using it. == Mechanics == The Site Activity Monitor shows an aggregate of all EMF spots (\"strength\") in the map over the last 60 seconds. The current strength is read at t = 0. For each interaction that results in an EMF reading, the level of activity shown on the monitor will increase by that corresponding level of EMF, plus an additional integer modifier between -2 and 0 per interaction. * For example, a single EMF Level 3 interaction that occurred 30 seconds ago, modified by -1 on the monitor, will show up as a horizontal line of strength 2 between 11 - 30 seconds. Higher levels usually indicate that more interactions or certain high-level activities recently took place. During a hunt, the activity level will always be 10. However, having an activity level of 10 does not necessarily indicate that a hunt is ongoing or is about to occur; the ghost could have manifested, or simply interacted with multiple objects at once or in quick succession. Though the Site Activity Monitor only goes up to 10, the actual total amount of EMF at any one time may exceed 10. Similarly, an activity level of 0 usually, but does not always mean no activity; the ghost could have performed an EMF 2 interaction that was adjusted to show as level 0 on the monitor. == Tips == Some observations from the activity monitor could help in identification of the ghost. * A jump of 4 or 5 levels on the monitor may mean, among other things, that an EMF Level 5 interaction has occurred. * The Twins's ability involves two interactions almost at the same time; usually 1 second apart. Seeing a negative slope (left-to-right, may or may not be differentiable) stretching across 2 seconds (width of 1 box) could indicate, among other things, this ability being used. It is important to note that such observations are only potential indicators, and not foolproof; other events may also cause the same observations and therefore look like the above has happened. It may be appropriate to treat its usage as science; multiple observances of such indicators could more strongly suggest (but not confirm) the conclusions. Some \"false positives\" could include: * A ghost event can show an activity increase of anywhere from +2 to +10 (including +4/+5), depending on the fluctuation applied and whether the event caused nearby doors to close. * Similarly, the Poltergeist's multi-throw ability can show up as any amount of activity, depending on the number of items thrown. * Using various cursed possessions to perform a ghost event or interaction could, other than showing up as any activity level, also cause a gradient that looks like a double interaction. * When a hunt ends, the activity level will drop, which can look the same as an EMF 5 or a double interaction due to the ghost interacting during the hunt. == History == Category:Truck Equipment fr:Moniteur d'activité ru:Монитор активности zh:活动强度显示屏","title":"Site Activity Monitor","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Site_Activity_Monitor"}

Tanglewood can often make for a swift investigation due to its small size, but the open floor plan and only three accessible coat-closets can cause it to be very dangerous during a hunt. ==Structure== Tanglewood has three bedrooms (including a nursery), two toilets, a garage, and a basement, among other rooms. ===Layout tips=== *The \"Master Bedroom\" consists of the room of the bedroom itself, the attached bathroom, and the attached closet. *The \"Foyer\" consists of both the hallway starting from the front door until the closet at the end of the hall leading into the living room, and the hallway parallel to it connecting \"Boy Bedroom\", \"Nursery\", and \"Main Bathroom\". *A maximum of 9 light switches can be turned on at once before tripping the breaker. ===Key hiding spots and strategies=== There are 6 \"sanctioned\" hiding spots in Tanglewood: *Foyer, closet between nursery and bathroom *Foyer, closet next to living room *Boy Bedroom, closet across from bed *Nursery, behind the crib *Garage, lockers along far wall *Basement, behind upright plywood Depending on the difficulty, some of these hiding spots will be filled with bulky items or missing their concealing elements, preventing players from hiding in them: *Amateur: None *Intermediate: 2 *Professional: 3 *Nightmare/Insanity: 4 *3-player game: +1 available hiding spot *4-player game: +2 available hiding spots <small>Additional hiding spots on multiplayer is overriden when \"Number of hiding places\" is set to None</small> Another decent, but unofficial hiding spot is in the nursery. It is opposite of the crib hiding spot, behind the changing table. Looping the ghost may be performed around the kitchen island, dining table, or the car in the garage. Where needed, the player may hide at the rear of the car, or crouch behind the kitchen island. ==Bone locations== Bones spawn randomly, but will only spawn in areas that a ghost can also walk on. ;Examples <div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\"><gallery widths=\"185\"> Long bone tanglewood livingroom.png|A long bone in the rug in the Living Room, which may be easy to miss.

This was later scrapped as it was deemed too hard for players to do so on larger maps. The name \"Nancy\" above the baby crib in the Nursery is also a reference to this mechanic. *The assets used for this map can be found here. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !19 September 2020<br>(Part 4) |Removed skeletons that were only visible to dead players. |- !0.6.1.0 |Moved the Utility door from the kitchen to the hallway. |- !0.7.0 |Renamed Tanglewood Street House to 6 Tanglewood Drive. |} ==References== Category:Small Map Category:Maps fr:6 Tanglewood Drive ru:6 Tanglewood Drive","title":"6 Tanglewood Drive","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/6_Tanglewood_Drive"}
{"content":"The Yurei is a type of ghost in Phasmophobia. Although it does not have any implicit bonuses to its ability to hunt, its main distinction is its ability to quickly drain sanity: if players are careless, it may become aggressive quicker than anticipated. ==Behaviour== ===Activity=== When Incense is used on the Yurei, in addition to preventing hunts and temporarily increasing activity, it will return to its favourite room and be trapped within it for 90 seconds, stopping it from roaming through the location. It can still leave that room by performing a ghost event, but it will return to it once the event ends. If the Yurei is affected by incense during a hunt, it will only be trapped in its favourite room after the hunt ends for the remaining time of the cleansing effect. Outside of its ability, the Yurei doesn't have an increased chance to interact with doors. When interacting with a door, the Yurei cannot slightly move it and can only either close it completely, or open it completely. This doesn't apply to hunts. {| class=\"mw-collapsible mw-collapsed fandom-table\" !colspan=\"2\"|Advanced mechanics |- !colspan=\"2\"|WARNING: This data is based on testing and not officially verified. |- !D.O.T.S state |The Yurei cannot enter a D.O.T.S state while it is affected by an Incense's cleansing effect. |} ===Ability=== When choosing to use its ability, the Yurei will first check if its current room has an opened door. Doors that count for this ability are mostly room doors, as well as exit doors, large tent doors on campsites, Dining Room cabinet doors and Living Room/Games Room fireplace doors on Point Hope, and washing machine doors and Morgue doors on Sunny Meadows. Hiding spot doors, however, do not count. If the check is successful, the following is caused: *All players within 7.5 metres of the ghost will have their sanity decreased by 15%. Players outside the investigation area will not be affected by the sanity drain. *The ghost will randomly select one opened door in the room and close it fully in a smooth way (as opposed to a strong slam) without any creaking sound. This in turn produces an EMF 2 interaction on that door. **Large tent doors will not fully close. ==Evidence== ==Strengths and weaknesses== These are the strengths and weaknesses as listed in the journal: Strength: Yureis have been known to have a stronger effect on people's sanity. Weakness: Smudging the Yurei's place of death will trap it temporarily, reducing how much it wanders. ==Strategies == Keeping doors open at a 45° angle near the ghost will help one to observe how it interacts with doors. Outside of hunts, a ghost not opening or closing a door fully will immediately rule out the Yurei. Alternatively, if the ghost shuts a door fully in a smooth way without any creaking sound and without a ghost event or a hunt, then it is a Yurei. This must not be confused with a door strongly slamming or a door closing with a creaking sound, which all ghosts can do, including the Yurei. If the Yurei refrains from using its ability, one can look out for its weakness with Incense once its favourite room is found: use it on the ghost, then set up Motion Sensors at the room's doorways. If the ghost passes through the sensors and exits the room within 90 seconds of it being affected by the Incense, and without having performed a ghost event to do so, then it is not a Yurei. ==Trivia== *Yūrei (meaning \"dim spirit\" or \"faint spirit\") is a general term for ghosts or spirits in Japanese. Yūrei can be motivated by a wide range of emotions relating to their death (or last thought when dying) that can range from benevolent (caring for children, handing out sweets, etc.) to malevolent (getting revenge, making others suffer, etc.). Yūrei contain a range of sub categories of ghosts including Onryō and Goryō. The appearance of a Yūrei can vary just as much as its purpose, some are indistinguishable from normal people while others can resemble horrific monsters. *The Yurei, though regarded as having a \"stronger effect on people's sanity\", does not increase the passive sanity drain of players, nor does it have an increased drain from pseudo-line of sight like with the Phantom. Furthermore, the Jinn's ability to drain 25% sanity rather than the Yurei's meager 15% while the Jinn has other abilities ironically makes the Yurei weak when juxtaposed to other ghosts. *The Yurei's ability can drain sanity from dead players, making them having less sanity than before their death if they get revived. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access Alpha |- !5 August 2020 |Added Yurei. |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !0.2.11.0 |Added the Yurei's ability to drain sanity of nearby players. |- !0.3.0 |Prior to 0.3.0, the evidence was Ghost Orb, Ghost Writing, and Freezing Temperatures. |- !0.5.0 |Doors near the Yurei will now close when it uses its sanity drain ability. |- !0.5.1.0 |Only one door will now close instead of multiple when the sanity drain ability is used. |- !0.6.2.0 |Players outside the investigation area will no longer be affected by the Yurei's sanity ability. |- !0.8.0 |The Yurei can no longer use its ability if it is in a room that does not have a door. |} ==References== ==Notes== ru:Юрэй fr:Yurei Category:Ghosts","title":"Yurei","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Yurei"}
{"content":"Yokai is a type of ghost in Phasmophobia. It is sensitive to voices, and becomes more aggressive while players are speaking nearby, which allows it to start a hunt even at high sanity levels. At the same time, while it is hunting, the radius in which it can hear players is much smaller compared to the other ghost types. ==Behaviour== ===Activity=== Utilizing voice chat near the Yokai at any sanity will increase its rate of activity. When a Music Box is used, the Yokai must be closer to the box (within 2.5 metres instead of 5) for it to trigger the ghost event and eventual cursed hunt. ===Hunt=== When at least one player uses voice chat in the same room as the Yokai, its hunt sanity threshold is temporarily increased to 80%. Otherwise, it has the standard threshold of 50%. During hunts, a Yokai can only hear players or sense handheld active electronics that are within 2.5 meters of it. Its line-of-sight is unaffected. ==Evidence== == Strengths and weaknesses == These are the strengths and weaknesses as listed in the journal: Strength: Talking near a Yokai will anger it, increasing the chance of an attack. Weakness: When hunting, a Yokai can only hear voices close to it. ==Strategies== The Yokai is identifiable through two distinctive traits: it will hunt more often when players are together and talking near it, but its ability to detect hidden players during a hunt through voice or electronics will be limited. For example, it will be less likely to follow the player past multiple line-of-sight breaks, and will not be attracted to held electronics unless the Yokai is already very close to the holder. Although its 80% hunt threshold is theoretically the highest in the game, even greater than that of the Demon (outside of its hunt ability) and the youngest Thaye, in practice, these extremely early hunts are rare. The Yokai does not have any additional buffs (and is in fact weaker) when hunting, so escaping it will be generally easier. To test for a Yokai during a hunt, stand at a distance close enough to where the ghost is currently at that is outside of the ghost's immediate line of sight, preferably near a hiding spot, and then turn on an electronic device and/or begin speaking in voice chat. If the ghost does not seek out the player making this noise, especially if it causes disruption of the device and then passes by instead of homing in, then it is likely a Yokai. Note that the electronic disruption range is a little bit greater than the actual range in which most ghosts will actually sense the held device. Care should be taken to not mistake the Yokai's limited hearing and electronics detection sense with the Banshee ignoring players other than its target (if they are inside the investigation area) during a hunt, especially on Nightmare as both these ghosts share two evidence. The Monkey Paw's wish to unblock a hiding spot will cause the ghost to be able to hear the speech and held electronics of the player who used it from any distance, overriding the Yokai's weakness. This may make trying to test a Yokai from its trait much more difficult, and when playing singleplayer, outright impossible. In multiplayer, the Yokai becomes mildly more dangerous, as there are more players that could be talking near the Yokai at any given moment, and thus can elevate its hunt sanity threshold more often. Where possible, less experienced players should ideally keep voice communications as short as possible until the ghost room is found. Otherwise, completing objectives can be made easier by encouraging the Yokai to hunt through talking. Contrary to popular opinion, the Yokai does not hunt more aggressively if players speak near it, only raising its hunt threshold; this means that talking near it has no effect if the team's average sanity is already below the 50% normal hunt threshold, so if the sanity levels are already low, then there's no need to avoid using voice chat anymore. The Sound Recorder's record range, especially for tiers II and III, actually outranges a Yokai's electronics detection range; by utilizing a suitable hiding spot, it is possible to record a hunting Yokai as it passes by, without it detecting the player, to easily get a high-reward piece of media. ==Trivia== * In Japanese Folklore, Yokai (妖怪, or \"strange apparition\") is a term broadly encompassing unexplained phenomenons, supernatural apparitions or spirits, which can take a wide variety of forms going from animals to inanimate objects. ==History== {| class=\"fandom-table\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Early Access |- !0.29.6 |Added Yokai. |- !0.3.0 |Prior to 0.3.0, the evidence was Spirit Box, Ghost Orb, and Ghost Writing. |- !0.5.0 |Talking near the Yokai will now increase its activity. |} ==References== ==Notes== ru:Ёкай fr:Yokai Category:Ghosts","title":"Yokai","url":"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Yokai"}
